--- Navigation links ('Items','collections')â€¦
/omeka/application/views/functions.php
I commented out 'Items' and 'Collection' from being pushed into the 'navArray' variable

--- Exhibit Sections
/exhibitbuilder/views/public/exhibits/summary.php
Commented out the 'Sections' div

--- Exhibit 'Profile' vs 'Description' DB entry
When the ExhibitBuilder plugin installs it adds data to Omeka's DB.
I added another section, 'Profile', to the DB install
/exhibitbuilder/functions.php

--- Exhibit 'Profile' vs 'Description' Display
/exhibitbuilder/views/public/exhibits/summary.php
added a div that references 'profile' rather than 'description'

--- DspaceScraperPlugin
You can check the 'plugin.php' file for the code.
Currently, the function gets called in:
/omeka/application/views/scripts/items/item-metadata.php

--- DspaceRecentItemsPlugin
Check plugin.php
Currently called in:
/exhibitbuilder/views/public/exhibits/summary.php

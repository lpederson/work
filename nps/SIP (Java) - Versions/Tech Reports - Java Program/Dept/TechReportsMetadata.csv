The initial analytical model qualitatively predicts the occurrence of induced yaw forces and is suggested as a basis for further refinements and experimental comparisons. Expressions for the calculation of local forces and pressure distributions are developed for the case of an axymmetric steady vortex wake.

It points out significant (but usually overlooked) errors which result from the conventional method of imposing the boundary conditions in such problems. Revised finite difference formulas are derived which apply near the boundaries and which eliminate the above errors. Three commonly encountered boundary conditions are considered. These correspond, in the terminology of beam analysis, to a clamped end, to a simply supported end and to a free end. The improvement in accuracy that can be achieved with the revised formulas is illustrated by two representative examples. The revised formulas are shown to reduce the overall error of the numerical solution by a factor of about five in a typical case.

The technique has been used to quickly and easily obtain information on the variation of the Nusselt number on right circular cylinder placed in a crossflow of air.  In addition to yielding precise quantitative heat transfer information, the liquid crystal thermographic technique afforded the opportunity to visually observe the effects of the flow separation, the separation bubble region, the turbulent boundary layer, and the turbulent wake on the surface temperature of the heated cylinder.

Experimental results are presented for water, ethyl alcohol and freon-113 in a stainless steel heat pipe rotating for speeds of 2800 RPM. Results show that these devices can be used effectively to transfer large quantities of heat in rotating systems. Predicted results agree to within plus or minus 20 percent of the experimental data.

Thermal performance data are presented for air flow rates to 3.38 CFM across fiberglass/epoxy and aluminum core circuit boards, each containing nine resistor elements to simulate IC components. Hot spot areas on the boards are shown using both liquid crystals and thermocouple data. Results show that in designing such standard packages, care must be taken to avoid obstructions in the air flow path. These obstructions can cause poorly circulating flow regions near the circuit boards, leading to hot spots and poor thermal performance of the IC components. The use of an aluminum core circuit board can significantly reduce this hot spot problem.

In addition the function, chi sub nm(y), which is orthogonal to phi sub nm(y), over the interval -1 or - y or - plus or minus 1 is tabulated. In a previous report (Gawain and Clark)1971) it was shown that these eigenfunctions can be extremely useful in describing certain aspects of the nonlinear mechanics of wave disturbances in plane Poiseuille flows. It is hoped that the present report will serve both as a complement to the previously mentioned report and as a useful reference for similar future investigations.

This also involves the turbulent energy, which is analyzed with the aid of empirical expressions for dissipation and diffusion. A characteristic local length scale is introduced, based on a generalization of von Karmon's mixing length. The model is illustrated by application to a channel and a jet.

It is shown that for very low amplitude disturbances the numerical integration scheme yields results that are consistent with those predictable from linear theory.  It is also shown that because of non-linear interactions a growing unstable disturbance excites higher wavenumber modes which have the sam frequency, or phase velocity, as the primary mode.  For very low amplitude disturbances these spontaneously generated higher wavenumber modes have a strong resemblance to certain modes computed from the linear Orr-Sommerfeld equation.  In general it is found that the disturbance is dominated for a long time by the primary mode and that there is little alteration of the original parabolic mean velocity profile.  There is evidence of the existence of an energy equilibrium state which is common to all finite-amplitude disturbances despite their initial wavenumbers.  This equilibrium energy level is roughly 3-5% of the energy in the mean flow which is an order of magnitude higher than the equilibrium value predicted by existing non-linear theories.

In attempting to obtain an exact time dependent solution, several significant results were observed. First, with regard to the formulation of the differential equations themselves, it appears that Poisson's equation for the pressure field is a fundamental equation in as much as it allows us to solve for pressure moat exactly at any given time. Secondly, the difference equations must be carefully and consistently formulated. In this research, a non-uniform lateral grid, a unique interpretation of the continuity equation, and leap frog integration in time proved to be valuable techniques in obtaining an exact solution.

Both deterministic and stochastic attrition processes are considered.  For the optimal control of deterministic Lanchester-type attrition process, a general solution algorithm for the synthesis of the optimal policy is developed.  Optimal allocation policies are developed for numerous one-sided optimization problems of tactical interest in order to study the dependence of the structure of these optimal policies on model form.  Consideration has been given to singular extremals, multiple extremals (including dispersal surfaces), and state variable inequality constraints.  It is shown how to apply the theory of state variable inequality constraints to determine the optimal control of deterministic Lanchester-type processes in order to treat non-negativity restrictions on force levels and thus to study the dependence of optimal policies upon the force levels.  Various attrition models are considered (reflecting different assumptions as to target acquisition process, command and control capabilities, target engagement process, variations in range capabilities of weapon systems).  Solutions are developed for Lanchester-type equations of modern warfare with variable attrition-rate coefficients.  The optimal control of the Lanchester stochastic process is studied.

Several specific problems for the determination of optimal time-sequential fire distribution strategies for supporting weapon systems are studied.  Optimal air-war strategies are studied within the context of land-war objectives and compared to those for a model which does not explicitly consider the ground war.  Several differential game models are used to study optimal fire-support strategies in an attack scenario.  For an existing differential game fir-support model we determine for what class of criterion functional (i.e., objectives) the optimal fire-support strategies are independent of force levels.  In a similar differential game we examine the dependence of optimal fire-support strategies upon the functional form of the combat attrition model by considering slightly different combat dynamics.  Some relatively new theoretical developments are required for the complete solution of this latter problem.  Previous analytic work in the field of determination of optimal fire-support strategies is reviewed.

Tabulations of these functions, which we call Lanchester-Clifford-Schlafli (or LCS) functions, allow one to study this particular variable-coefficient model almost as easily and thoroughly as Lanchester's  classic constant-coefficient one.  The availability of such tables is pointed out.  We show that our choice of LCS functions allows one to obtain important information (in particular, force-annihilation prediction) without having to spend the time and effort to compute force-level trajectories.  Furthermore, we show from theoretical considerations that our choice is the best for this purpose.  These new theoretical considerations apply in general to Lanchester-type equations of modern warfare and provide guidance for developing other canonical Lanchester functions (i.e. canonical functions for other attrition-rate coefficients).  Moreover, our new LCS functions provide valuable information about various related variable-coefficient models.  Also, we introduce an important transformation of the battle's time scale that not only many times simplifies the force-level equations but also shows that relative fire effectiveness and intensity of combat are the only two weapon-system parameters determining the course of such variable-coefficient Lanchester-type combat.

Use of the representers of point evaluation functional is shown to be possible for up to 100 points or so in B [1,1].  Two schemes for introducing basis functions which are zero in certain regions, including one set which have compact support, are investigated.  Again, these are primarily useful for B [1,1].  In the space B [2,2], which contains only continuously differentiable functions, use of the representers is possible only for small data sets unless one can use a great deal of precision in solving the system of linear equations which arises.  The generation of basis functions with compact support is also possible in B [2,2].  The general conclusion is that local schemes must be employed, particularly for smooth approximations.

Consequently simple approximating techniques have great practical value. The hazard transform of a system is an invertible transformation of its reliability function which is convenient and useful in both applied and theoretical reliability work. A simple calculus for finding an approximate hazard transform for systems formed by series and parallel combinations of components is extended so that it can be used for any coherent system. The extended calculus is shown to lead to conservative approximations. A first order version of the extended calculus is also discussed. This method of approximation is even more simple to use, but is not always conservative. Examples of its application indicate that it is capable of giving quite accurate results.

This paper presents significant experimental and theoretical advances which correctly describe the electromagnetic properties of the crossed-dipole receiving antenna illuminated by a monochromatic source.  Results are presented for electrically moderately thin structures.  In practice, when a crossed-dipole receiving antenna is excited by a broad spectrum electromagnetic pulse, certain important electrical resonances occur:  that is, at specific single frequencies of excitation some portions of the structure can support large amplitude standing wav3es of current and/or charge.  Under such conditions a current maximum/charge minimum, current minimum/charge minimum, or current minimum/charge maximum may occur at the junction region.  Examples of resonant and antiresonant situations for the parasitic monopole and the crossed dipole which highlight the possible interactions between the arms of the crossed dipole are presented which give insight into methods of analyzing aircraft in an electromagnetic pulse environment.

The payoff to Emitter is zero if the prediction is a correct one. The games differ in additional assumptions--those are in particular: Predictor required to make his prediction after observing a prescribed number of digits of the sequence; Predictor allowed to observe any number of digits but earning a decreasing amount for each correct prediction as the number increases; The period of the emitted sequence being chosen by random from some fixed distribution; Emitter allowed to choose the period but being paid a decreasing amount for incorrect prediction as the period increases. Combining these assumptions two zero-sum and two nonzero-sum games are obtained.

The problem is to determine the optimal number of dispatches K given there are n available and to determine sequentially the epochs of dispatch tau sub 1, ..., tau sub K. There are two trade off costs c sub w and c sub d, which are respectively the cost per unit time of a waiting customer and the cost of dispatching a single unit. A general result is found which gives one optimal tau sub 1, ..., tau sub K for fixed K (i.e. the K-optimal policy) under certain regularity conditions. This is used to obtain suboptimal policies for multiple dispatching of a Poisson process and single dispatching of a birth-death process. Applications to problems in transportation, repair facilities and insect-control are indicated.

Often, an investigation is performed by discretizing the random variables at point-quantile levels, or by outright simulation. This paper addresses the problem of characterizing the inner product of two stochastic vectors with arbitrary multivariate densities. Expressions for means of variances of vector products are obtained, and used to make Tchebycheff-type probability statements. Included are applications to stochastic programming models.

In [4] Hayne and Marshall analyze a two-characteristic Markov model which can be viewed as a hybrid of the Markov and longitudinal models.  The purpose of this paper is to show how efficient  computational methods can be used with the two-characteristic model by exploiting the special structure of its underlying matrix.  These methods make possible the efficient use of this basic flow model in optimization models similar to those described in Chapter 5 of [3].

By utilizing a computer, a method has been developed which overcomes this problem.  In this new method the evaluators must compare their ratees to other specific ratees (anchors) who are under other evaluators.  All ratees receive their scale value based on their relative position to the anchoring points that were used by the evaluator.  A trial of the method was made on ten groups, each composed of 12 graduate students.  Each group has two evaluators.  The characteristics rate were Industry, Academic, Ability, Judgment, and Cooperation.  These were considered as relevant characteristics to the ""job"" of being a student.  The groups had been relatively intact for approximately one year prior to the evaluations.  A comparison of the results of using the standard fitness report rating method (RAW) and the man-to-man method (MM &MMQ) revealed that the man-to-man method was superior based on certain statistical qualities.  The man-to-man method resulted in a greater spread of scores and, more importantly, resulted in higher inter-rater agreement than the standard rating method.  An outside criterion of Quality Point Average was available for the ""Academic Ability"" scale.

Performance values can be determined also for operation without reheat.  Influence of temperature and fuel/air ratio on the thermodynamic properties of air and combustion gases is taken into account.  A calculating program for a Monroe 1880-43 programmable electronic desk calculator is described which makes it possible to evaluate effects of changes of parameters on performance with minimum effort.  The program will be used to establish the characteristics of compressors required for propulsive units of later generation Navy air-superiority fighter aircraft, to investigate whether the Turbo-Propulsion Laboratory of NPS would be capable of undertaking research and development work of such machines.  Programs of the type presented, and the use of modern programmable desk calculators, will also be of great value for instructional purposes.  Teachers can then concentrate on the fundamental nature of particular topics and need not waste time on lengthy derivations, or on simplifications and approximations that are introduced only to solve equations with elementary means.

The initial stator, or diffuser, consisted of two cascades of unswept and untwisted blades arranged and designed as in an axial compressor.  The performance was measured with two diffusers of different solidities and with changes in the blade stagger angles.  The maximum efficiency approached 80%, however, the flow was separated in the second blade row for all diffuser designs tested.  Surveys from hub to tip at the rotor exit revealed an unusually larger variation in flow angle.  Approximations were obtained from normalized distributions of velocity and angle from all tests which will allow the design of a diffuser with swept or twisted blades.  It is recommended that such a design be tested to provide a more definitive assessment of the ""Hybrid"" concept.  The reported tests were the first conducted in a new turbine-driven compressor test rig at the Turboprobulsion Laboratories.  An account is included of the verification of flow, torque and temperature measurements and of a  method devised to overcome the difficulty of establishing the performance with highly non-uniform total pressure distributions from multiple passages within a thin annulus.  The method, which was analytically correct and required the input of a particular number of sample measurements, gave results almost identical to the conventional mass-averaging technique.

Research on an engineering basis has been accomplished as to the feasibility of disposing of outdated military munitions in a confined space, and also as to the practicality of explosion product gas recovery for reuse in explosives synthesis.  Disposal in a confined space is advantageous when one wishes to dispose of large batch configurations of explosive devices which are dangerous to uncase, where another method does not exist, and from the standpoint of environmental impact.  For example, a twenty-five ton high explosive shot may be easily contained within a cavity of about sixty-eight feet in diameter, with great attenuation of the shock wave and complete containment of the product gases.  Confined space disposal is at a great disadvantage when other methods of disposal exist, such as wet-air oxidation or controlled incineration, when munitions may be uncased or when continuous operations are feasible.  Primary disadvantages are the danger in transporting old, sensitive devices, initial investment required, emplacement costs and dangers in bringing sensitive ordnance material within sympathetic detonation distances before the shot is fires.  Also, in general, reclamation of the product gases and conversion to useful products in no feasible.

Experimental results have been obtained for three heat pipes (1.6 cm, 2.5 cm and 5 cm diameter) operating with methanol or Freon 113 as the working fluid and krypton or helium as the control gas. Results show that gravity tends to distort the axial temperature profiles on the small diameter pipe. For the large diameter pipe gravity has the effect of causing a stratification of the working fluid and non-condensible gas. These results seem to indicate that in certain cases the presently available design procedure will have to be modified to account for the effects of gravity on variable conductance heat pipe operation.

It is shown that active coupling at a given frequency may be achieved between two lines supporting waves with different phase constants provided they are coupled periodically with a periodicity determined by the difference B(2)-B(1) at that frequency. Since B(2)-B(1) will, in general, vary with frequency, coupling over a broad frequency range requires a variable period. This may be realized by scaling the structure period, thereby giving rise to a log periodic mode coupler. This technique appears to hold promise for achieving the same wideband performance that has been attained with log periodic radiators.

The process has the characteristic properties that the number of points in any finite set of nonoverlapping intervals are mutually independent random varialbes, and that the number of points in any of these intervals has a Poisson distribution. This paper first discusses several general methods for simulation of the one-dimensional nonhomogeneous Poisson process. Then a particular and very efficient method for simulation of nonhomogeneous Poisson processes is stated with log-linear rate function. The method is based on an identity relating the nonhomogeneous Poisson process to the gap statistics from a random number of exponential random variables with suitably chosen parameters. Finally, a simple and relatively efficient new method for simulation of one-dimensional and two-dimensional nonhomogeneous Poisson processes is described.

A residual mixing distribution is the probability distribution for different failure rates in the population of surviving devices after a specified period of service or ""burn in.""  Residual mixing distributions resulting from arbitrary mixtures of constant failure rates are shown to be stochastically ordered (decreasingly) as the period of service or burn in is increased, and to approach in the limit a distribution degenerate at the smallest failure rate ""present"" in the population.  The results are direct applications of basic propositions concerning monotonicity properties of residual mixing random variables and their expectations.

The multivariate life distributions that are induced when several ""components,"" each with its own breaking threshold, are exposed to the same cumulative damage process are of interest in their own right, and are important examples in the general study of multivariate life distributions.  This paper is a summary of some results about the very special, but central, case in which the cumulative damage process is a compound Poisson process.  It is focused on the multivariate life distributions that arise when the component breaking thresholds are random and have a Marshall-Olkin multivariate exponential distribution.  There are two relevant multivariate life distributions that can be derived, an intermediate distribution for the number of shocks (cycles) to failure and the final distribution for the actual times to failure.  The results have application to the life distribution of a coherent system whose components are exposed to the damage process.

Damages accumulate additively. Each device has its own random breaking threshold. A device fails when the accumulated damage exceeds its threshold. Thresholds are independent of damages, and have a Marshall-Olkin multivariate exponential distribution.

In conjunction with the trajectories, air parcel properties of vertical motion, acceleration, divergence, vorticity, static stability and total energy have been studied with respect to development, growth, movement and decay of the storm system. Basic assumptions are that the flow is frictionless and adiabatic over the entire grid. The results show that the observed winds do provide some skill in formulating isentropic trajectories which demonstrate the presence of storm activity in the specific region. The investigation of a mesoscale inertial-gravity wave having a wave length of 150 KM, period of 3 hours and phase speed of 14 m/sec is also presented, with its possible correlation to the onset of the severe storm.

Tests with a 4th-order advection scheme did not lead to significant improvements over the 2nd-order advection. It was concluded that the most likely source of error was due to data deficiencies in the western Pacific. Wind direction estimates based on Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) photographs were compared to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) hand-analyzed streamlines. About 65-70% of the DMSP direction estimates at the gradient and 250-mb level were within + or - 10 deg of the handanalyzed fields.

Although a potentially infinite number of samples may be available the statistician is allowed to base his inference only on the current value of such a statistic -- the current state of his finite memory.  This is the case for instance when the inference is to be performed by a small size computer.  During the past several years a number of results have been obtained concerning a two-hypotheses finite-memory problem.  In this report we consider some aspects of the case where the number of hypotheses is greater than two.  In particular we derive a bound on the error probability for the 3-hypothesis case, present a counterexample to a recently proposed conjecture and briefly discuss a finite-memory version of the minimax theorem.

The idea is to identify a sequence of control random variables, each one defined within a regenerative cycle, whose mean can be calculated analytically. These controls should be highly correlated with the usual quantities observed in a regenerative simulation. This correlation reduces the variance of the estimate for the parameter of interest. Numerical examples are included for the waiting time process of an M/M/1 queue and for several Markov chains.

A model is developed, based on the assumptions of normal ballistics, perfect observation of impacts, adjustments without error, and a unimodal target destruction function.  The problem is to determine optimal adjustments, in order to maximize the probability of target destruction within a given number of rounds.  It is shown that seemingly different adjustment procedures are equivalent, if viewed in appropriate coordinate systems.  Previous results concerning sequential adjustments which are constrained to be linear functions of observed impact points are extended to the class of translation invariant procedures.  Properties of the optimal sequential adjustment procedure, including some related to stochastic approximation, are reviewed.  The effects of errors in judging impact positions are discussed.

One approach the these problems comprises the interactive combination of data-analytic procedures with probability modelling. This paper describes methods, both old and new, for the statistical analysis of non-stationary univariate stochastic point processes and sequences of positive random variables. Such processes are frequently encountered in computer systems. As an illustration of the methodology an analysis is given of the stochastic point process of transactions initiated in a running data base system. On the basis of the statistical analysis, a non-homogeneous Poisson process model for the transaction initiation process is postulated for periods oh high system activity and found to be an adequate chracterization of the data. For periods of lower system activity, the transaction initiation process has a complex structure, with more clustering evident. Overall models of this type have application to the validation of proposed data base (sub) system models.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,00|aData base management., 0|aMathematical statistics.; 0|aElectronic data processing.,,,,"1 |aShedler, G.

In addition, we describe the SASE VI program which has been developed to implement the methodology for the statistical analysis of series of events in the monograph on this subject by Cox and Lewis.  Various subroutines perform, among other things, tests for monotone and cyclic trends, tests for renewal and Poisson processes and two different types of spectral analysis.  The program can also be used to analyze any series of positive random variables such as counts of events in successive fired time intervals in a point process.  It has been programmed in both FORTRAN and APL.  Multivariate series of events (point processes) present a much more difficult task and the methodology for their analysis has only recently been developed in a perforce fairly tentative manner.  Applications in the analysis of computer system data and neurophysiological data are given.  One problem here is the need for new data analytic methods for the analysis of data when trying to build models, and the lack of simple models for non-normal, positive multivariate time series.  Some starts in these directions are described.

Lagrange's equations were used to develop a set of governing dynamic relationship using four generalized coordinates including missile roll angle, fin-opening angle and fin bending and torsion deflections. The latter two coordinates provided an elastic representation for accommodating the fin's transient response during the fin-opening process. Sufficient details were provided so that the analytic model could be modified for other missile and fin configurations, including addition of more fin bending degrees of freedom. Comparison was made between the analysis results and a limited amount of experimental evidence. Agreement was reached with fin-opening times and an indirect conclusion was reached that initial fin- opening angle rates were in the range of 35 to 50 radians/second. The fin elastic response was shown to be dependent primarily upon the fin bending mode. Peak stress encounters by the fin root beyond yield could be avoided by configuring the ERGP obturator rings to control initial missile roll rates to less than 15 revolutions/second. This latter point is important since local yielding of the fins by excessive bending stresses, incurred during launch, can adversely effect the trajectory dynamics by contributing to the presence of a residual roll rate.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |akmc/kmc 10/23/09.,,,,, 0|aRockets (Ordnance); 0|aGuided missiles|xWings.; 0|aAerodynamics|xMathematical models.; 0|aProjectiles.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA064874,  |lgen|nL|aUF767|b.S35|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768001728645,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The combat is between two heterogeneous forces, each composed of infantry and a supporting weapon system (artillery). In contrast to previous work reported in the literature, the attrition structure of the problem at hand leads to force-level-dependent optimal fire-support strategies with the attacker's optimal fire-support strategy requiring him to sometimes split his artillery fire between enemy infantry and artillery (counterbattery fire). A solution phenomenon not previously encountered in Lanchester-type differential games is that the adjoint variables may be discontinuous across a manifold of discontinuity for both players' strategies.

The authors consider the optimal time-sequential allocation of supporting fires during the 'approach to contact' of friendly infantry against enemy defensive positions. The combat dynamics are modelled by deterministic Lanchester-type equations of warfare, and the optimal fire-support policy for each one-sided combat optimization problem is developed via optimal control theory. The problems are all nonconvex, and local optima are a particular difficulty in one of them. For the same dynamics, the splitting of supporting fires between two enemy forces in an optimal policy (i.e. the optimality of singular subarcs) is shown to depend only on whether the terminal payoff reflects the objective of attaining an 'overall' military advantage or a 'local' one. Additionally, switching times for changes in the ranking of target priorities are shown to be different when the decision criterion is the difference and the ratio of the military worths of total infantry survivors and also the difference and the ratio of the military worths of the combatants' total infantry losses.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aTactics|xMathematical models.; 0|aCombat|xMathematical models.; 0|aFire control (Gunnery)|xMathematical models.,,,,"1 |aBrown, Gerald Gerard.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA033760,  |lgen|nL|aUF848|b.T24|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768001729098,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Lanchester-type equations for a square law attrition process are used to model the combat. Command and control limitations are incorporated into the model through upper and lower bounds on the rate at which the distribution of fire can be changed. The structure of the optimal fire distribution policy is examined. It is shown that such command and control limitations do not essentially alter the optimal fire distribution decision rules, although the shifting of fires is initiated earlier when command and control limitations exist than when an entire force can instantaneously shift their fires from one target type to another. Thus, when there is inertia to overcome in shifting fires, one begins to change the distribution of fire before target priorities change in anticipation of this coming change. The theory of state variable inequality constraints plays a major role in solving this problem. Of particular mathematical difficulty is the presence of a second order state variable inequality constraint in the problem.

The experimental and analytical hydraulic ram and structural response programs at the Naval Weapons Center (NWC) and the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) are briefly described. The computer analyses for the fluid pressure at the entry and exit walls and the transient entry and exit wall strains are described in detail. Comparisons are made of the predicted wall strains with the circular entry wall strains, measured at NPS, and the square exit wall strains, measured at NWC. Good agreement in the form of the strain histories is obtained, but the magnitudes of the predicted strains are smaller than those of the measured strains. This study contributes to the knowledge of the hydraulic ram phenomenon and associated fluid-structure interaction, and should provide some useful information for the design of aircraft fuel tanks.

Special attention is paid to the stock-out risks assumed whenever reorder levels are set using the various methods being compared. Models presently used by NavSup are employed in order that the results be applicable to the system in use. Simulation techniques are used for drawing comparisons. For constant mean, normal demand, it is shown that exponential smoothing does not produce as accurate results as ordinary maximum likelihood techniques. For the case of a linear mean changing with time, it is shown that the two methods are about comparable. Finally, a sequential Bayes forecasting method is defined and found to compare quite favorably with exponential smoothing. The need for additional study of Bayesian methods is established.

One general approach to determining 2which system is best involves forming a composite measure of the differentially weighted component measures.  It is fairly common practice to control the component means and variances; it is less common, and more difficult, to control component covariances and, thus, to control the contribution of a component to the variance of the composite measure (variable).  This paper presents a method leading to a computer procedure for assigning equal or differential influences on the composite by the use of component means, standard deviations, and cova4riances.  In this method covariance terms are allocated equally between each pair of components.  Two numerical examples are given herein, one illustrating equal and the other unequal weighting.

A typical autocorrelation function of signal plus noise was used to form the Toeplitz coefficient matrix. Thirty separate data sets of systems of order 4 through 128 were formed, and the resulting equations were solved by each of four different algorithms. IMSL's LEQT1F Gauss elimination procedure, run in double precision, was used as the standard for comparison of accuracies. The results show that the Levinson algorithm is to be recommended for small (order 16) systems to which it is applicable.

Students entering the program have diverse academic backgrounds, some having had extensive training in mathematics and related subjects and others having hav very little previous work in mathematics.  A student who already has the necessary background may attempt to validate the courses through examination, but there is presently no effective transcript review process to facilitate validation.  Nor is there any formal process for placing students in mathematics courses on the basis of their ability and previous training.  This study analyzes the factors influencing student performance in these three mathematics courses.  Validation guidelines are presented for two of the courses, and a procedure for establishing validation guidelines which could easily be applied to other courses and to other curricula is described.  Recommendations for changes in the mathematics program for management students conclude the paper.

The demand for courses is generated by the preparation of curricular programs under the cognizance of curricular chairmen. Students invest in courses supplied by discipline-oriented departments under the cognizance of the traditional departmental chairmen. The quasi competition within bounds provides a range of free curricular enterprise beyond the minimum Master degree requirements for an interlocking curricula superstructure containing pertinent concepts in disciplines of other school sufficiently meaningful to attract and educate those needed to define and solve the urgent problems of contemporary society.

The rules of the game, determined in part by the nature of the pursuer's weapons, are such that the evader must be able to discriminate reliably between straight-line and maneuvering pursuer motion.  A suggested method for such discrimination is tested by simulation.  The method employs bias-sensitive maneuver detection and gain-adaptive discrete Kalman filtering.  Also tested is a smoothing scheme for establishing long-term trends in a pursuer's maneuvering track.  The outcome of both tests indicate that the suggested processing methods may be useful in the formulation of fire control policies for destruction of maneuvering targets.

Cases can be fabricated of drawn steel, spiral wrapped steel, or other materials, the most promising of which is fiberglass. For primers the major options are to rework an existing inventory, to redesign the primers using the traditional technology, or to redesign the primer using more advanced technology.

The primary problem is a lack of knowledge as to how advertising, as input, affects an output, such as sales. All Navy advertising expenditures for 1976 and 1977 were allocated to counties by month for 1976 and 1977 and supplemented with recruiting and environmental data to examine the relationship between advertising and enlistments. Total advertising expenditures were moderately related to total enlistments (R sq = .442), but this relationship was found to be the result of management planning and allocation of resources and goals. When advertising and enlistments were made rate variables, there was no linear relationship because the rate of advertising increased rapidly without a corresponding increase in enlistment rates. A fourth root transformation of advertising rates permitted application of a linear regression model where advertising was found to be the most significant predictor of enlistment rates. Recommendations are made for further studies and actions to evaluate and increase advertising effectiveness.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ oclc 7/9/09.,,"10|aUnited States.|bNavy|xRecruiting, enlistment, etc.",,, 0|aAdvertising|xRecruiting and enlistment.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aVB263|b.A81|s1|tnorm|c00002|u00001|i32768001746159,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The distribution is a function of the total volume of advancees to a pay grade of the rating as well as the LOS distribution of the net inventory of the next lower pay grade of the same rating. The model previously tested for three ratings only is now extended to all ratings of the Navy Enlisted Force. The new procedure is then compared and found to be superior to the currently used method of distributing advancees among LOS cells. This conclusion is based on the accuracy of the FY 1976 estimates.

The present study used that (regression) model as a starting point to accomplish the same goal with a gamma distribution model appropriately parametrized to make it dependent on volume of advancements. The latter model appears nearly as accurate in its predictions as the regression model, while reducing the number of parameters from ninety-three to fifteen for each pay grade of each rating.

Mass storage devices have high potential for those applications which have a requirement to store a large data base (10p10s-10p12s bits) on-line. 2. Mass storage devices should be considered as supplements to conventional storage devices for large data base applications, and used as part of a hierarchical storage system, rather than as replacements for conventional storage quipment.  3. Mass storage devices are not competitive with conventional storage equipment for direct access processing.  4. Erasable mass storage devices are competitive with conventional storage equipment for sequential file processing.  5. Non-erasable mass storage devices are inappropriate for high activity file processing but can be employed to advantage in archival storage applications.  6. As in the case of conventional storage units, the file activity ratio is a prime consideration in the selection of a file processing technique for mass storage.  Low activity ratios favor address look-up or calculation and direct file access.   High file activity ratios favor batched input and sequential file",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 8/20/09.,,,,, 0|aData tapes.; 0|aMagnetic memory (Computers); 0|aMagnetic recorders and recording.,,,,"1 |aSchneidewind, Norman F.;1 |aSyms, Gordon H.;1 |aGrainger, Thomas L.;1 |aCarden, Robert J.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aTK7881.6|b.S62|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768001747967,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This has been accomplished through an examination of the stability concepts underlying the classical inviscid theory of plasticity. From a phenomenological viewpoint, the two theories differ in the nature of unloading, the dilatation behavior, the form taken by the dewetting criterion, which is analogous to the yield criterion of plasticity theory. Some restrictions to an allowable functional form of the dewetting criterion are developed, and a specific criterion compatible with these restrictions is suggested. A time-temperature superposition method is developed, using the proposed criterion coupled with reaction rate theory. Stress analysis for materials which exhibit anisotropy after dewetting is discussed, and sample problem solutions are given for quasi-elastic pressurization and slow cool-down of an encased hollow cylinder in plane strain, in which the extent of dewetting increases with time.

Experimental techniques used were high speed motion pictures, tow-color schlieren, laser schlieren, and centrifuge mounted combustion bombs.  It was found for double-base propellant that the temperature increased continuously from the surface into the visible flame.  Acceleration induced burning rate augmentation occurred and resulted in elimination of the visible flame.  Acceleration apparently modified the surface or subsurface zones.  AP/binder sandwich combustion was also found to be acceleration sensitive with binder flow-AP interactions proposed as the mechanism.  Composite propellants burned with local diffusion flames to pressures as slow as 100 psi.  A comparison is made between AP/binder sandwich combustion and propellant combustion.

In the absence of a well defined objective function covering the possibilities under consideration, value judgments, based only on qualitative information many times, were needed.  In the present paper we demonstrate that there exists a set of public policy decisions which, using the implications of previously determined political decisions, demand only quantitative market information.  These are decisions concerning the fee structure of government (municipal, state or federal) facilities which have characteristics of both private and public goods.  AN example of the relatively straightforward nature of the necessary data to determine the optimal fee structure of a municipal swimming pool is constructed and used to illustrate the major points of the paper.

The assumptions deal with uniqueness among the skills of organization members and among skill demands of organization roles.  The algorithms calculate the distributions of all logically possible arrangements of s people filling k roles.  This procedure yields a percentile role differentiation indicator (PRDI) for any given organization size s under each of the five general assumptions.  A PRDI value indicates how much of an organization's empirical role differentiation is accounted for by size, allowing an investigator to examine the effects of other influences upon complexity.  A series of PRDI values across time tell the effects of other variables besides size upon the complexity of a growing organization.  In cross-sectional analysis, PRDI values eliminate the logical effects of size alone upon the complexity of a set of organizations of different sizes.

The general approach was to derive regression equations from a dependent data sample of nearly coincident subsatellite points and rawinsonde locations. The validity of the equations was checked with a smaller independent sample of SIRS radiances from a later period. Tests with the ballistic wind component normal to the path of the NIMBUS 3 suggested standard errors of less than 10 kts can be achieved. Both zonal and meridional components can be calculated from SIRS-B radiance data which is grouped in clusters. Because the geostrophic ballistic wind is proportional to a horizontal gradient, several techniques were attempted for calculating the gradient at the central point of the irregularly spaced set of data.

The investigation included 238U, 140Ce, 89Y, 60Ni, 58Ni and 28Si, which combined with our previous studies of 208Pb, 197Au and 165Ho, form a survey of the giant resonances in many nuclei. The energy resolution of about 0.4% to 0.5%, was usually sufficient for studying these broad resonances; the excitation energy range covered was from 4 to 40 or 50 MeV, and showed giant resonances of energies from 6 to 33 MeV. Forward scattering angles were used resulting in only electric multipole resonances. The cerium experiment possibly revealed more than any other single nucleus studied. In addition to E2 Delta T =0) at 10 MeV and E1 at 15.3 MeV, the isovector E2 appears at 25 MeV. E3 resonances appear at 6.0 MeV, 22 MeV and 34638 MeV in general agreement with the model of Bohr and Mottelson. For Uranium, both quadrupole resonances were observed, but were low in strength unless a transition radius larger than the ground state radius was assumed. Systematics of the resonance at 53 cu.rt. (1/A) MeV showed a smooth and drastic decrease with strength as a function of decreasing A, a behavior not seen for the GQR at 63 cu.rt.(1/A) MeV.

The inventory management policies thus include regulating the input of blood into the bank, the transfer of blood from the refrigerator to the freezer and the issuing policy of blood for various medical needs.  Concomitant to these problems is the problem of forecasting demand.

Complex temperature and sound-velocity profiles were found near the Alaskan Coast north of the ice margin, diminishing in intensity toward the interior of the ice pack but still noticeable 30 miles inside the ice boundary.  West of the coastal zone, to 167 [degrees] W, the phenomena were much milder and more quickly damped by the ice.  The coastal current was observed to turn, perhaps branch, and flow along the Beaufort Sea slope, below the surface at a depth of 25-50 m, to a longitude of 152 [degrees] W.

In addition to measurements in ice-free waters, seven closely spaced crossings of the sea-ice margin were made along with two crossings of the Alaskan coastal zone. In all, 111 STD stations and approximately 100 XBT drops were made for which graphs and tabulations were produced of temperature, salinity, density and sound speed. South of the ice the water is sharply layered with a warm fresh layer (8-10 C and approximately 10m thick) above a cold dense layer. At or near the sea-ice margin the layering gradually disappears with modification of isopycnals and isotherms extending to the bottom. Large scale temperature fluctuations of 0.5 to 2 C, termed mesostructure, were observed at 12-15m depth in the first three crossings, but were weak or absent in the other crossings. Mesostructure appears to be correlated with a relatively rapid melting of the ice, and hence, probably with a strong northward flow, or a diffuse ice margin . Mesostructure formation is believed to result from non-uniform lateral mixing of waters of different temperatures but the same density, possibly modified or controlled by a complex lateral pressure field near the ice.

Although this correlation function is shown to be predictable simply from the depth of the experiment, it is of only limited validity with respect to large spatial lags. However, a Gaussian extrapolation of the 'universal' correlation function together with the standard deviation of the index provides simple useful predictions of the sound fluctuations due to temperature microstructure in the upper ocean.

Because of dispersion due to ambient bubbles, average phase speeds in the frequency range 15 to 100 kHz differ as much as 2.5 m/sec from the accepted 3MHz ""precision"" velocimeter values down to depths of 6.76m in the presence of wind speeds of 25-30 knots.  These differential speeds imply average bubble volume fractions of the order of 10p-7s with standard deviations approximately one-fifth of the mean value.  The differential sound speed is now shown to increase approximately proportional to the wind speed.  The third power decrease of differential speed with increasing depth is roughly verified.  Under these experimental conditions the predominant cause of the local phase fluctuations at 24.4 and 95.6 kHz is shown to be bubble activity rather than temperature fluctuations.  At 24.4 Khz the activity is the random change of number of bubbles.  At a frequency such as 95.6 kHz, where there is a large resonant bubble population, the predominant part of the frequency spectrum of the sound phase modulation is shown to be caused by changing bubble radius due to the fluctuating ocean surface wave height.  The sound phase spectrum mimics the wind wave spectrum given by Pierson and Moskovitz t to two octaves beyond the frequency of the peak energy, at which point the surface pressure effect has dropped low enough for temperature fluctuations to take over.  A theory is presented for prediction of these microsturctural sound phase fluctuations from a knowledge of the surface wave height spect",,,,,,,,  |akmc/kmc 10/13/09.,,,,, 0|aSound|xTransmission|xResearch.; 0|aUnderwater acoustics.; 0|aOcean waves.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aQC233|b.M43|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768001784218,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The purpose of the tutorial is to facilitate the intelligent use and adaptation of such Lanchester-type combat models to defense-planning problems. It emphasizes those aspects of the Lanchester theory of combat that have been useful for developing operational combat models. It focuses on how the combat-attrition process is conceptualized and on the delineation of the assumptions involved with using each particular attrition-rate-coefficient expression (i.e. model of a single-weapon-system-type kill rate). Enrichments in both the target-acquisition process and also the line-of-sight process are discussed in detail. Those aspects and methodologies that appear to be important for future enrichments (e.g. detailed modelling of command and control) are emphasized. Both homogeneous-force combat and also heterogeneous-force combat are considered, as well as attrition-rate coefficients for different weapon-system types.

The method takes as given a formal specification of a user's problem. The specification is allowed to be incomplete in that some or all of the input conditions may be omitted. A completed specification plus a computer program are produced by the method. Synthesis involves the top-down decomposition of the user's problem into a hierarchy of subproblems. Solving each of these subproblems results in the synthesis of a hierarchically structured program. The program is guaranteed to satisfy the completed specification and to terminate on all legal inputs. In this paper we present a framework for a top-down synthesis process, explore the structure of a class of divide and conquer algorithms, and present a method for the top-down synthesis of algorithms in this class. Detailed derivations of four sorting algorithms are presented.

A reparable item inventory system is composed of an inventory of ready-for-issue (RFI) items and an inventory of non-ready-for-issue (NRFI) items awaiting repair at the overhaul and repair facility. Since not all units issued in RFI condition will be recovered, procurement is necessary to supplement repair and maintain the population of units. This report describes such a system and presents a number of mathematical models, both deterministic and probabilistic, which prescribe the manner in which such a system should be operated.

A target is a patroling submarine and the vulnerability arises because of the ability of a surveillance system to determine the submarine's position from time to time. The analysis is based on the following model: A target is exposed to a surveillance system periodically. The distance the target moves during an exposure is essentially zero, but the exposure is long enough so that the detection of the target by the surveillance system can occur. The target is aware of its exposures, but the exposures are unavoidable. When a target is detected by the surveillance system, the target's position is determined, but no other information is obtained. The position, which will be called a datum, determines a search region in a plane that is bounded by circle of radius U sub MXT that is centered on the datum where U sub M is the target's maximum patrol speed and t is the time since detection. A searcher is cued by the surveillance system; but, due to various causes, a delay (time late) occurs before the start of a search.",,,,,,,,,,,,, 0|aNavigation|xMathematical models.; 0|aNaval strategy|xMathematical models.; 0|aAnti-submarine warfare|xMathematical models.; 0|aMotion|xMathematical models.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,01|aNPS-71-82-001.,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aV165|b.F67|s1|tnorm|c00001|u00001|i32768000520886,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

These issues are: why is the change in input prices a particular problem for Navy contracts?  Why is escalation a good procedure for dealing with the problem?  What are the possible side effects of using escalation procedures?  How is the trade-off between administrative cost, accuracy and contractor incentives (moral hazard) reached?  For each separate issue as well as for the set of interrelated issues a discussion indicating its general applicability as well as its specific applicability to individual case is given.  After the issues discussion the area of implementation of escalation is considered as a series of four questions: What prices should be covered?  How should the price changes be measured?  When should the measurements be made? How should the price changes be compensated?  These questions are given general answers in each case and the set of questions as a whole is also considered.

The requirement existed for an instrumentation package having a low noise figure, a large dynamic range, and the capability of rapid field maintenance. The instrumentation package was designed and constructed at the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. The design conforms to practices which lead to good electromagnetic compatibility.

A relationship between registrations and national interest is suggested, and 10 countries are identified that account for 84.3 percent of registrations in the 225-400 MHz band. Ten countries are also identified that account for 96.4 percent of registrations in the 500-890 MHz band. Seventy percent of transmitters registered in the 225-400 MHz band have power levels of 100 watts or greater, while in the 500-890 MHz band, only 35 percent operate at this level. Intermittent operation dominates the 225-400 MHz band; registrations indicating 24-hour continuous operation dominate the 500-890 MHz band. These findings have implications in terms of potential interference between terrestrial users and current and future Navy SATCOM operations.

The model developed incorporates the relevent physical aspects of the various possible interferers and postualtes a statistical framework in which these signals are inserted. A simulator based on the developed model was built to serve as a tool for study of the effects of the various interferers upon shipboard satellite communications systems. The simulator is capable of generating 10 types of complex emitters and of providing linear and nonlinear processing of them.

The contractor is assumed to maximize the expected utility of managerial emoluments, performance of the contractor's product and corporate annual net income over a finite planning horizon. This maximization is constrained by the technology of research and development, test and evaluation, manufacturing and a centralized warehouse-inventory operation. There are commercial sales as well as a number of on-going and potential DOD projects. An extensive accounting model of the contractor is included. Corporate financial management involves the issuing the retiring of short- and long-term debt and equity in addition to the choice with respect to dividends and retained earnings. The inputs of the contractor include plant and equipment (both contractor and government supplied in T and E), engineering support labor (both contractor and government supplied in T and E). administrative labor, manufacturing labor, weapon system operators (both contractor and government supplied in T and E), material, purchased parts, subcontracted items, and government furnished items. Risk is introduced by considering each possible alternate event due to such factors as rivals' actions, technological risk, capital market conditions and variation in government and commercial sales to be grouped in states-of-nature. Thus, the contractor is assumed to plan for a variety of future state-of-nature (contingencies) and chooses a complete plan (inputs, outputs, financing, proposal bids, etc.) for each contingency.

It is a simple case of a more general model. The economic system may be a group of firms, a single firm, or a part of a firm. The technique, referred to here as revenue and expense apportionment, is particularly suited for joint cost and joint product situations such as those encountered in transportation, petrochemical production, and industrial funded activities in the Government. The principal theme of the apportionment concept is that revenues and expenses can be logically distributed among activities by using a transfer pricing mechanism so as to reveal how each segment shares in a system's overall return on investment, even when joint products are involved. The apportionment concept assigns returns to the activities involved in creating products and services; this is in contrast to approaches that distribute revenues and expenses directly to products and services. The apportionment concept is also linked to profit maximization concepts when the model of the system meets some fundamental requirements. The managerial and economic applications of the apportionment methodology include segmental investment evaluation, limited segmental performance analyses, pricing analyses and regulation. Included in this paper is a brief discussion of existing approaches, a description of the way in which a system is to be modelled in order to apply the apportionment technique, a discussion of apportionment concepts, their interpretation, numerical examples, and some economic implications.

Various forecast methods are compared using simulation relative to mean squared error when mean demand is allowed to vary according to specified patterns.

The relationship between satellite cloud brightness and large-scale 200mb divergence on 5À x 5À grids in the tropical western North Pacific is examined from several angles.  Correlation coefficients between the two fields are computed on a daily basis for the region of study and at each grid point for 8-month time series.  The coefficients are mostly low although a positive correlation is generally indicated.  The low correlation may be due to the quality of the available data, especially for the divergence which is kinematically computed from analyzed winds.  Spectrum analysis is also performed to determine dominant synoptic time scales for both parameters in the period of study.  Two common period bands, one centered ~ 10 days and the other ~ 5 days, are found.  Cross-spectra between the two parameters indicate that their phase differences are small (< 1/4 cycle) for both bands, but the coherence squares are somewhat lower than those found previously by Wallace for the 4-to 5-day waves using direct radiosonde data.  Horizontal structures of both parameters, determined from inter-longitude cross-spectra in the two bands, suggest that the brightness is much more organized than divergence, but the two fields resemble each other whenever an organized pattern in divergence can be found.  The results of this study lend some support to Wallace's postulation, but also indicate some problems for using the present data.  It is anticipated that the correspondence with the actual divergence field will be greatly improved if satellite infrared data is incorporated into the brightness data.

The charge on soap film bubbles was measured and it was found that for a 2 inch bubble formed at 30 kV the charge was on the order of 1 micro Coulomb. Tests of fog clearing in an environmental chamber indicated fair results with water spray techniques and much better results with techniques by which charge is injected directly into the atmosphere (corona injection). Preliminary tests of corona injection into the atmosphere were carried out and showed that considerable charge attached to windborne particles.

The paper presents a methodology for analyzing the effects of possible policy changes in a state's prison/parole system on future prison and parole populations. A simulation model is presented, viewing a prison/parole system as a feedback process for ciminal offenders. Transitions among the states in which an offender might be located, imprisoned, paroled, and discharged, are assumed to be in accordance with a discrete time semi-Markov process. Projected prison and parole populations for sample data and applications of the model are discussed.

A series of points along 175 deg W and along 38 deg N were chosen for use in this preliminary study. Atmospheric forcing for the one-dimensional ocean model was derived from the surface heat budget calculations in the Fleet Numerical Weather Central (FNWC) atmospheric prediction model. The suitability of the FNWC heat flux calculations was evaluated through comparison with the upper ocean heat content changes derived from the TRANSPAC analyses. The comparisons showed better agreement along 175 deg W than along 38 deg N. A series of ocean thermal structure predictions from 15 September to 31 December 1976 were made using the time series of the atmospheric forcing and the initial profile from the September TRANSPAC analysis. In the central region near 38 deg N, 165 deg W the predicted thermal structure agreed very well with the TRANSPAC analysis for December 1976. Near the southern and western ends of the domain, the temperature predictions were systematically lower than the analyzed values between the surface and 200 m.

These quantities can be adequately expressed in terms of the Fried model by means of a single number, the turbulence structure constant for optical index, (C sub n) squared, provided that a properly path-weighted value is obtained. The behavior as a function of wavelength and range is also well understood. The quantity (C sub n) squared, which varies with the micrometeorology, can be determined in its properly path-weighted form with a slit-scanning telescope system developed at NPS. A portable system is available which includes an on-line data processing system that gives immediate numerical and graphical results for the properties of the atmosphere, together with performance prediction for a given optical system. The direct optical measurement of weighted (C sub n) squared for the path avoids the necessity of making a large number of measurements of (C sub t) squared at points along the path.

Whereas the radiosondes investigated in Model Atmospheres (I) consisted entirely of ""checked-data"" quality, those stations desiagnated for study in this work required a much more refined data-screen, due to lack of initially checked radiosonde report quality.  Nevertheless, after application of various acceptability criteria, the radiosondes at each station were arranged in the same format as employed in Model Atmospheres (I).  There remained in each case a suitable sample population to provide significant results.  The ensuing multiple regression analysis applied to the geographically and climatologically diverse set of stations of the current study led to realistic estimates of the temperature profiles which were conditionally dependent upon the existence of 1% extreme forcing-level temperature TJ at previously designated pressure levels PJ.

Using empirical expressions for atmospheric absorptivity, scattering-reflectivity, cloud-reflectivity and earth-surface reflectivity, the useful solar insolations absorbed at earth and in the key atmospheric layers above the earth have been formulated. The terrestrial cooling effect at earth and in these same key atmospheric layers have also been formulated using recently published emissivities for the joint effects of water vapor and CO2. As a result, the radiative heating (cooling) at key levels may be ascertained for input into the atmospheric thermodynamic equation. In addition, application of atmospheric boundary-layer modelling permits determination of the surface-layer turbulent transports (in the vertical) of sensible and latent heat at the earth's surface.

The most logical sequence for the application of corrections would be: terrain correction (if necessary) to reduce bathymetric irregularities to a flat, horizontal bottom; removal of the upward attraction of the water above the meter; free-air correction to bring the meter measurement of the surface of the reference spheroid; filling in the ocean below the spheroid with rock for a Bouguer anomaly calculation or with water for a free-air anomaly calculation.  The terrain correction must be handled carefully as the bathymetric irregularities are immersed in water of finite density and, due to the close proximity of land, topographic irregularities immersed in air may be within the range of the correction graticule grid.  Graticule compartment weighting factors for making this correction may be readily determined by breaking the bottom-land surface profile into several segments delimited by the gravimeter depth and the sea surface.

The intensity of the hurricane is related to the equivalent potential temperature gradient produced by a balance of heat sources and advection within the boundary layer. Solutions are obtained using the bulk aerodynamic transport equations or applying a two-layer, baroclinic boundary layer model by Cardone (1969). Equilibrium maximum wind speeds vary from minimal hurricane force to about 80 m/sec for fixed ocean temperatures between 27C and 31C. Observations of the oceanic heat loss in actual storms are necessary to establish the ratio of heat flux to momentum transfer in the high wind speeds treated by the model. Various applications of the model are proposed, with an ultimate goal of a time-dependent simulation of hurricane-ocean coupling.

The time period extended between 15 May 1966 through 28 July 1966. The stepwise regression procedure was employed to derive statistical estimator equations for each mean map field Z(5)(I,J,t+1) in terms of the preceding field data Z(5)(I,J,t) as the primary predictor, (t+1 = 2, ..., 15). As additional predictors, the 5-day mean composited gridpoint values of the NIMBUS II MRIR equivalent black body temperatures in the water-vapor channel (denoted T(1)) and the window channel (denoted T(2)) were introduced bor both analyses times t(1) and t+1.

The operational model, called DGT*, employs the isobaric gradient of virtual potential temperature (T*) to specify baroclinicity while a directional second derivative of T* is the parameter used to locate the HBZs and indirectly give a measure of their intensity. The DGT* model is diagnosed from an analysis of modeled temperature profiles and a number of real-atmosphere temperature fields at 1000, 850, 700, and 500 mb, as taken from winter and summer situations in the years 1964-67. Consideration is given to location, intensity, frequency, slope, and vertical and horizontal distribution and consistency of the HBZs in relation to the numerical processing of data. A key synoptic time, 0000 GMT 6 March 1966, serves to exemplify analytical and diagnostic features of the HBZs. The numerically-analyzed 1000 mb fronts, produced operationally by Fleet Numerical Weather Central, Monterey, California since 1965, are statistically and graphically compared to subjectively-analyzed versions for winter and summer periods up to 30 days. The relation of the HBZ to vertical motion and cloud is illustrated by a case study from December 1966.

The major purpose of the Antarctica test was to monitor the durability of the platform and its sensors and electronics, under harsh climate conditions. Instrument redundancy was employed for the measurement of pressure and wind. Data transmission from the sensors was effected by the Nimbus 6 Random Access Measurement System (RAMS). The evaluation is represented by a statistical analysis of the deviations of AWS readings from official observations at South Pole and McMurdo, as appropriate.

It is normally found within 20-35 km outside of the ice and seldom farther than 5-10 km inside the ice margin.  It has also been infrequently found more than 100 km south of the ice.  Temperature and salinity fronts of all degrees of sharpness occur in the same general area, but the two types need not be coincident.  Considerable variability in time and length scales of fine structure elements has been noted with persistences ranging from 2 hours or less to more than 20 hours and length scales ranging from 600 m to more than 20 km.  While much of this variability is intrinsic, part can be accounted for by the inability to sample in the direction of flow and the relative motion between the sampling platform and fine structure element.  Fine structure lenses are considerably longer parallel to the ice edge with similarity in temperature structure noted over distances of 80 to 100 km.

This study investigates the possible roles played by the temporal and spatial sea-surface temperature (SST) variations on the waves. Time series of tropical western pacific radiosonde data during two contrasting eight-month periods of SST anomalies, May-December 1972, which has abnormally high SST in the central and eastern Pacific, and May-December 1973 which has below normal SST in the same region, are analyzed. In both periods, the waves have the same periodicity of 4-5 days and a lower tropospheric zonal wavelength on the order of 3300 km, but their vertical phase and amplitude distributions as well as the thermal structures are different. The results are discussed in terms of two possible influences the SST variations may have on the waves: 1) direct effect, the warmer SST represents stronger thermal control through cumulus heating; and 2) indirect effect, the variation of SST changes the large-scale mean wind circulation which, in turn, has a strong impact on the wave vertical structure and the relative importance of energy sources other than cumulus heating. Finally, a schematic model of these influences is proposed which may be applied to both the temporal and the spatial variations of SST.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 8/10/09.,,,,, 0|aOcean-atmosphere interaction.; 0|aTropical meteorology.; 0|aAtmospheric circulation.; 0|aOcean temperature|zPacific Ocean.,,,,"1 |aMiller, Charles Robert.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aGC190|b.C4|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768001878796,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

In this investigation, the sea surface is described by a single harmonic in x and the wave induced motion in the atmosphere is restricted to this harmonic. Buoyancy effects are neglected and the turbulent fluxes of momentum are approximated in terms of an eddy viscosity. The equations are integrated numerically until a steady-state is achieved. These solutions show that the nonlinear terms which were neglected by Yefimov are important, and that they generally lead a smaller response.

The results which were achieved are the following: (1) all validation tests were passed; however simulation results were generally higher than analytical results and (2) the general direction of the relationship between complexity measures and error detection was as expected; however, considerable variability was exhibited when single independent variables were used. It appeared that a multivariable model involving error detection and several program complexity measures would be more appropriate.

A progress report was submitted on 15 January 1975.  The purpose of this project was to develop a methodology and tools for conducting system tests of avionics or other complex hardware/software systems.  Two areas which received major emphasis were prototype testing and maintenance testing.  A methodology for conducting prototype tests was developed.  In addition, a simulation model was prepared for aiding the designer and tester in identifying and diagnosing faults which may occur during prototype testing.  A maintenance testing methodology, which involves the use of tests to partition faults into subsets, was developed for identifying faults.  In addition to the above areas, research was undertaken to develop models for investigating the relationship between error detection capability and program structure in computer software, using simulation and analytic approaches.  The models would be employed during software design for identifying program structures with poor error characteristics and during test planning for the purpose of allocating test resources in accordance with error characteristics.  In addition to the progress and final reports, computer program source decks and operating instructions for the system (prototype) test simulation and the software error detection (simulation and analytic) models have been provided to NADC.  Lastly, three national conference proceedings publications and presentations and tow Master of Science in Computer Science theses have resulted from this research project.

Specifically, min path sets and min cut sets of a coherent system are given several characterizations. The modularity of a subset of components is given a new characterization which is used as a definition. The situation under which a set and its complement are simultaneously modules is characterized. Finally, the established three modules theorem is given a new proof.

For systems with exponentially distributed failure times, it is shown that the MG procedure, using the same data as the LR procedure, will always compute a lower bound than the LR bound. Simulation methods are used to infer that only when failure data are ordered so that a significant portion of the data is not incorporated by the LR procedure, will the LR procedure have a reasonable expectation of producing a superior bound to the MG bound.

Beyond this, the complexity of interactions must be understood more thoroughly and this requires an educational effort on a broad basis. A practical and systematic approach toward the solution of these problems is developed.

The core component of this algorithm is a two-dimensional contouring algorithm that operates on a single, 2 x 2 subgrid of a larger grid. A model for the operations used to generate the contour lines for a single subgrid is developed. The inadequacies of the currently published algorithms, with respect to contour line generation for a subgrid, are pointed out in a brief review of the available literature. A data structure, the contouring tree, is introduced as the basis of a new algorithm for generating the contour lines for the subgrid. The construction of the contouring tree, and the completeness of an algorithm based upon the contouring tree, within the constraints of the contouring model are shown.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 3/25/09.,,,,, 0|aComputer graphics.; 0|aContours (Cartography)|xData processing.; 0|aGrids (Cartography)|xData processing.; 0|aAlgorithms.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,0 |aNPS-52-84-011.,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aT385|b.Z93 1984|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768000585780,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

A five-year climatology suggests than an average of about 13 convective events occurs each winter, and that two of three cases are likely to have intense and well-organized convection. Five events that occurred during the First Special Observing Period of the First GARP Global Experiment are selected for detailed study, Associations are sought between the post-frontal convective areas and standard synoptic and dynamic variables. The convection appears to be closely tied to the position of the upper level cold trough. Cold advection aloft and low-level heating as the cold air streams over the warmer ocean contribute to maintenance of low static stability in the convective region. The feasibility of diagnosing the location of the convective regions is explored with diabatic and frictional parameterizations of the Naval Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS). Wind, temperature, geopotential and moisture fields from the ECMWF are used to specify the large-scale forcing. The cumulus precipitation diagnosed by the NOGAPS does agree surprisingly well with the post-frontal convective areas in these five cases.

Water depths at the sites ranged from 8 to 175 m. A steerable cardioid receiving pattern was formed using signals telemetered from dipole and omnidirectional hydrophones suspended from tethered buoys. With no nearby shipping, whenever the maximum of the cardioid pattern was directed toward the beach, noise levels in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 70 Hz were greater than those obtained when the maximum was directed seaward. This difference or anisotropy (seaward vs. shoreward), which depends on range from the beach, on frequency and on surf intensity, was 10 dB at 300 Hz at the 9 km site during very heavy surf. Surf beat was clearly audible when the cardioid maximum was steered shoreward at ranges as great as 2 km. During heavy surf, the omnidirectional ambient noise levels also increased significantly in the same frequency range at which the anisotropy is evident. The anisotropy effects diminish both in magnitude and in frequency range with lower wave height but are still observable during light surf. We have concluded that intense breaking surf can contribute significantly to ambient noise in fairly deep continental shelf waters.

Because of their widespread use and the ease of fiber dissemination, friable asbestos materials are considered to be the major source of asbestos fiber contamination in the indoor environment. Encapsulation of asbestos materials with a commercial sealant product is one of several methods used to control potential asbestos exposure in rooms. A sealant product that preserves most of the acoustical properties of the material is preferred in this usage. AFIM sample materials were treated with 6 types of sealants and the effects on normally incident absorption coefficients from 100 to 2500 Hz were measured using a fixed, dual-microphone technique. 'Penetrating' type sealants were found to have a less detrimental effect on sound absorption than those of a 'bridging' type.

The engine layout incorporates a half wavelength or can be run in a full wavelength with dual prime movers and dual coolers coupled thermally in parallel.      Both simplified models and more physically realistic models have been constructed and      adjusted for good performance. Simplified models indicate an overall COP of 0.48,      which means that the total cooling power is a factor of 0.48 smaller than the total heat      input. More detailed and realistic models indicate an overall COP of 0.43. Geometry      numbers have been finalized and much of the drafting for an experimental unit has been      completed. We hope that high power densities can be achieved with this engine. We also      believe that overall COP's in the range of 0.6 to 0.7 may be possible with further      improvements. Additionally, we have numerically studied issues of achieving acoustic      onset with this engine and the sensitivity of the onset condition to the model parameters.      We have also developed a new heat exchanger fabrication method which will allow us to achieve the smallness of geometry scale that was discussed in the previous report. The  practical result is better thermal coupling with less acoustic dissipation. The fabrication method is also considerably simpler than our previous method.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |aaq/  /aq cc:9116 02/26/97.,,,,, 4|aACOUSTIC RESONATORS.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Physics.,,,01|aNPS-PH-95-002.,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA301717,,,"  |aHEAT EXCHANGERS, ACOUSTIC RESONATORS, THERMAL PROPERTIES, HEAT TRANSFER, MATHEMATICAL MODELS, COUPLING(INTERACTION), OPTIMIZATION, PARAMETERS, ACOUSTIC WAVES, EFFICIENCY, DISSIPATION, COOLING, TEMPERATURE GRADIENTS, THERMAL ANALYSIS, ACOUSTIC MEASUREMENT, SOUND PRESSURE, ACOUSTIC IMPEDANCE, REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS, ENGINE PRIMERS;  |aIDE: THERMOACOUSTICS, POWER DENSITY, PE61153N",,,,

The use of the Cox  proportional hazards model resulted in considerable computational overhead and the      discrete proportional odds version (i.e., logit model) is examined instead. Since this model is supported by the generalized linear model software systems, some closely related  models are considered and compared, specifically the linear, probit, and complementary log-log. The existing exponential smoothing method is also included. There are a number  of important findings. First there is need to standardize the measures of performance. The  present study uses average magnitude relative error for sets of forecast cells. Second,  there is considerable variability in the forecastability of the attrition behavior of soldiers in the various personnel partitions; i.e., partitions made by cross classifying by education,  mental group, contract term, etc. The logit, probit, and exponential smoothing models perform about equally well within the partitions when used without covariates and focusing  on the involuntary losses. The inclusion of covariates in the generalized linear models  appears to have a disturbing effect and the relative errors are larger than before.

The realization of our methodology is the Constructive Interpreter which functions as a debugger as well as program synthesizer. It contains three major components: test case generator, bug locator, and bug corrector. The test case generator can generate test data systematically by executing specifications. The bug locator will automatically locate a bug should the program fail to compute an answer that agrees with the specifications. The bug corrector will analyze the nature of the bug and invoke correction heuristics which might involve the use of (1) a deductive theorem prover which will try to construct a proof and deduce sufficient conditions to amend the program, and (2) an inductive program generator which will synthesize the missing part of the program.

In addition, from the network manager's point of view, combat imposes electronic order of battle constraints that can affect network performance and limit the available network configurations. Optimizing message throughput under such design and operational constraints is extremely difficult. Intended as an aid to both network designers and managers, this study describes a network monitor that uses modern high-speed graphics hardware and a responsive multi-window user interface to depict, in real-time, the state of a packet-or circuit-switched tactical communications network.

The concepts fall into the broad category of combining information. Developmental testing (DT) refers to the testing of a new or upgraded system in the course of its technical engineering development. Operational testing (OT) is conducted later by operational military personnel in the field. Because of the rigors of field operation there is the expectation that OT failure rates are related to, but likely to be higher, than DT failure rates. The relationship between DT and OT failure rates is modeled and estimation of model parameters examined.  A likelihood-based pooling of observations from sensors with a range-dependent precision is  studied. Alternatives to the circular normal dispersion model are examined and estimation of  the model parameters sketched; experience shows that in projectile testing it is often the case  that some individual shots deviate from aimpoint more wildly than described by the customary  circular normal model.",  |aAlso available online,,,  |arequirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.;  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 09/11/97,,,,, 0|aMathematical models.; 0|aStatistics.; 0|aMathematics |xapplied.,,,,"1 |aJacobs, Patricia A.;1 |aFries, Arthur.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Operations Research.,,,01|aNPS-OR-97-012.,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA328590,,,"  |a*TEST AND EVALUATION, *MATHEMATICAL MODELS, *BAYES THEOREM, MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION, PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS, OPERATIONAL EFFECTIVENESS, STATISTICAL SAMPLES, MILITARY APPLICATIONS, SYSTEMS ANALYSIS, APPLIED MATHEMATICS.",,,,

By feasible we mean that it is possible to configure a number of (slave) minicomputers each of which is driven by identical database management software and controlled by a (master) minicomputer for concurrent operations on the database spread over the disk storage local to the slave computers. This approach to large databases may be desirable because only off-the-shelf equipment of the same kind is utilized to achieve high performance without requiring specially-built hardware and because identical database management software is replicated on the slave computers. The approach makes the capacity growth and performance improvement easy because duplicate hardware can be added and used with replicable software. In this report, we present a new approach to the solution of database management problems involving database growth and performance enhancement. A system which uses a multiplicity of conventional minicomputers, novel hardware configurations and innovative software design is presented. This extensible system tries to achieve the ideal goal of having the performance (both response time and throughput) be proportional to the multiplicity of minicomputers. Our first effort is to identify the major problems and bottlenecks involved in developing such an ideal system.

The limitations and bottlenecks of the conventional database computer (i.e. , the database management system, DBMS, utilizing either the mainframe computer or the backend computer) are delineated.  Unlike the database computer for small and simple databases, the database computers for very large and complex databases cannot rely on the upgrade of a conventional mainframe or a backend computer.  Nor can it rely on the latest introduction or version of the DBMS.  Instead, database computers for very large databases require new hardware organizations and novel software techniques in order to handle the databases cost-effectively and performance-efficiently.

It was first popularized by complex renderings of terrain on a computer graphics medium. Fractal geometry has since spawned research in many diverse scientific disciplines. Its rapid acceptance has been achieved due to its ability to model phenomena that defy discrete computation due to roughness and discontinuities. With its quick acceptance has come problems. Fractal geometry is a misunderstood idea that is quickly becoming buried under grandiose terminology that serves no purpose. Its essence is induction using simple geometric constructs to transform initiating objects. The fractal objects that we create with this process often resemble natural phenomenon. The purpose of this thesis is to present fractal geometry to the graphics programmer as a simple workable technique. We hope to demystify the concepts of fractal geometry and make it available to all who are interested.

Trade-offs between Type I and Type II errors can be controlled with and interactively defined program parameters. Parameters were found to yield a 16% missed detection rate with a 5% false alarm rate, performance entirely acceptable in speech compression applications. Some problems were encountered with sibilate detection, due to the close relationship between these sounds and white noise.

It leads to a basic-function approach to the design and development of multimedia database systems, which extends a relational database management system with new attribute types. In this paper, raster (or bitmap) images are used as an example. The structure of image values is defined, and a basic set of operations for access and manipulation is proposed. These operations can be integrated into a query language like SQL. To facilitate a contents-oriented search on multimedia data in general and on images in particular, text descriptions are introduced into the database that allow users to indicate the contents of an image. The well established techniques of information retrieval can be applied to search for these descriptions. The proposed system allows us to model images that are assigned to objects as well as stand-alone images. The paper finally sketches a prototype implementation on top of an existing relational database management system (Ingres).",,,,,,,,  |akmc/kmc 11/23/09.;  |aaq/  /aq cc:9116 11/06/97,,,,, 0|aDatabases|xManagement.; 0|aMultimedia systems|xDatabases.; 0|aComputer science.,,,,"1 |aLum, Vincent Y.;1 |aWu, C.

Immediate applications being addressed are: Space Shuttle exhaust hazard, site specific diffusion at Vandenberg, and generic features of flow and turbulence in complex, coastal terrain. Because the data may ultimately be used for modeling a wide variety of situations, such as continuous plumes, burst releases, rocket exhaust, the data acquisition procedures must be well designed. Specifically, sampling must be done so that the full range of the turbulence spectrum that is important for all types of diffusion is acquired.

Information from the latter is realistically subject to chance influences:  targets are found and correctly identified generally at rates proportional to their numbers,  locations, and activities, and to the coverage of shooter-serving sensors; the events of  detection are realistically random, as are the delays, results, outcomes, and follow-up of  the targeting shooters. In this paper a simplified version of the above complicated process is analyzed mathematically, here as a multi-stage queuing process with imperfect service.  The probabilistic outcomes can be used to anticipate the results of higher-resolution simulations; these often are far more time consuming both to set up and run. Aspects of the above queuing situations can also be deduced via a deterministic 'fluid' queuing approximation that gives an adequate and convenient representation of aspects of the state variables and various Measures of Effectiveness in the stochastic queuing model. Relying  on that agreement, we have elsewhere generalized the stochastic queuing model setup to  fluid models that incorporate omitted realities, such as losses from target-list tracking, and the inevitable time dependencies, non- stationarities, and adaptive behaviors that typically occur in actual military operations or vignettes. Both the stochastic and deterministic model results are informative and produce reasonable insights.

The shell element is an isoparametric element, and has four corner nodes at which there are three displacements and three rotations, independently. Therefore, the element formulation includes the transverse shear deformation and the transverse normal deformation. In addition, the formulation consists of separate components of the mean stress and deviatoric stresses because the Gurson constitutive model for void growth is based on the mean stress and the dilatation. As a result, the Gurson void model can be implemented in the shell formulation at the next stage. The shell element uses the reduced integration along the inplane axes and full integration along the transverse direction. If more accuracy is required along the thickness of the shell, a large number of integration points can be selected in the direction. Verification of the shell element was performed for a plate problem and a shell problem whose analytical solutions were available. The next phase of the work is to      implement the Gurson model in the shell element.

The backends are configured in a parallel manner. A new backend may be added by replicating the existing software on the new backend. No new programming or reprogramming is required. A prototype MDBS is being completed in order to carry out the design verification and performance evaluation. This report is the fourth in a series which describes the MDBS implementation. The processes in the MDBS controller (request preparation, insert information generation and post processing) and the processes in the MDBS backends (directory management, record processing and concurrency control) have been described in the previous reports. The concurrency control process, formerly used to control access to just user data, is modified to control access to directory data as well. The directory management process is also modified to improve the execution of update requests. Finally, a directory management is modified for the storage of directory data on the secondary storage.

The development of a database mangement system for the office automation environment becomes a high priority, in order to provide an efficient and reliable way to manage the information needs of the office. Therefore, the specification of an 'ideal' database sever for the office automation environment becomes a key area of concern. In addition to providing traditional support, the ideal database server must also provide new database support, in order to meet the unique and many needs of office automation environments. In this paper, we focus on the characterization and specification of an ideal database server for the office automation environment. We also consider how such an ideal database server can be effectively integrated into the office automation environment. Further, we examine an experimental database system, known as the multi-backened database system (MBDS), as a candidate for the ideal database server in the office automation environment.

The major subject of these studies was to measure the temperature of magnesium particles after the particles had been ejected from an exploding wire. The distribution of particle temperature along the track was measured by the two-color photo-pyrometry method (TC-PPM). A scanning microdensitometer served as a major data reduction tool in analyzing the film density due to the particle tracks as recorded on calibrated film. The initial temperature of the particle ejection from the plasma and at the beginning of combustion is 3430 K + or - 9.1%. At the initial phase of combustion, the particle consists of pure magnesium with spectral emissivity of about 0.25. During the combustion process,      magnesium oxide is formed locally on the particle surface. The oxide is in liquid state with emissivity of 0.9. In the second stage of combustion there are changes on the particle surface in correlation with optical density variation and explained by emissivity variations due to peeling of the oxide film and exposure of the pure magnesium surface. Solidification of the particle, which is magnesium oxide, is observed at the measured temperature of 3125 K + or    - 5.7%. The spearpoint effect, which is known in the literature as the Blick Effect, was observed at the end of the particle track. The particle supercools below the normal freezing point and then suddenly crystallizes.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.;  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.,,,,  |aaq/  /aq cc:9116 11/24/97.

Further, the  Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used for the stainless steel material to  determine their chemical compositions.

This requires the use of partial transfer lots. In this paper we address the problem from a theoretical point of view. We optimize the sizes of the transfer lots for overlapping processing on two machines to as to minimize the makespan under a constraint on the number of transfers.

Duplicating the MCM portion of the Kernel Blitz 95 exercise whenever feasible,      this thesis uses the Janus interactive combat wargaming simulation to model and evaluate  the effectiveness of the ALUV as a MCM. Three scenarios were developed: an amphibious landing through a minefield using no clearing/breaching; an amphibious landing  through a minefield using current clearing/breaching techniques; and an amphibious landing through a minefield using ALUVs as the clearing/breaching method.

The study was undertaken to identify patterns in the duty assignment system that are associated with retention. If patterns are identified that are controllable through the assignment system alternative strategies that increase retention may be developed. Configural (or pattern) analysis models were evaluated for accuracy and stability in providing estimates of retention proportions for a source-to-assignment matrix with several hundred possible assignment patterns. The major finding was that one of the SPA models provided more stable data than did the calculations based on the actual outcomes. This finding suggests that stable estimates of personnel retention proportions are possible for use with a source-to-assignment matrix in algorithms for optimizing the assignment of personnel.,  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,10|aUnited States.|bNavy|xOfficers|xPersonnel management|xMathematical models.;10|aUnited States.|bNavy|xPersonnel management|xMathematical models.,,,,,,,"1 |aRobertson, David W",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA080940,  |lgen|nL|aVB313.W44|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768000412043,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

CALOC performs four tasks: abnormality detection, time difference control,      recordkeeping, and blink control. The work reported in this report focuses on time  difference control. In many instances, CALOC does not accurately control the time difference error (TDE) within the established USCG control procedures. Two new      algorithms are proposed here to control TDE more effectively: a proportional integral derivative (PID) controller and a Kalman filter. Actual TDE data recorded at three    different master stations covering five LORAN-C chains is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed controllers. The PID controller shows a substantial      improvement in control compared to CALOC, and the Kalman filter exhibits even better performance, based on preliminary results. This improvement in control correlates directly with an increase in both predictable accuracy and repeatable accuracy.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 03/03/98,,,,, 0|aAlgorithms.; 0|aSignal processing.; 0|aLoran.; 0|aKalman filtering.,,,,"1 |aTummala, Murali.;1 |aFrance, Frederick M.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering.,,,0 |aNPS-EC-98-002.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/1998/NPS-EC-98-002.pdf|z(0.48 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA337871,,,"  |a*ALGORITHMS, *SIGNAL PROCESSING, *LORAN, REAL TIME, KALMAN FILTERING, FINITE DIFFERENCE THEORY, COMPUTER APPLICATIONS, SEAKEEPING, RADIOFREQUENCY INTERFERENCE, COAST GUARD, RADIO STATIONS, SURFACE NAVIGATION",,,,

Some changes in terminology were required to describe the synoptic regions that have characteristic track directions. All 1592 cases during the period could be described by these four synoptic patterns and 11 synoptic regions. Important track  changes were found to be associated with transitions between these synoptic patterns and  regions. Three binary tropical cyclone interactions defined for the Western North Pacific  were adapted for use in the Southern Hemisphere with considerable success. A      preliminary climatology of occurrences for the synoptic pattern/region combinations, ions, transitions between combinations, and binary tropical cyclone interactions are calculated.

The wavelet transform is applied along the delay and the time axes. Processing along the delay axis allows the identification of frequency hopped signals and estimation of  frequencies and switching times.

This report examines the  state-of-the-art in mode-locked lasers and their performance requirements when used for  wideband signal sampling. The required sample time uncertainty (jitter) and optical    pulsewidth are shown as a function of the Nyquist sampling rate. Nonuniform sampling      theory is also presented as a means to quantify the sampling jitter from spectrum analyzer      measurements. Various laser configurations and mode locking techniques are discussed with      emphasis on the measurement of the laser performance. A summary of the measured pulsewidth and minimum jitter times for a number of lasers reported in the literature is presented. The design for a (NRL) sigma laser currently being constructed at NPS is also      discussed. To relax the requirements on a laser's required sample time uncertainty, 1st and      2nd order optical sigma delta architectures are investigated.

The observation-to-grid interpolation methods considered included most of those in present meteorological use, such as optimum interpolation and successive corrections, as well as proposed schemes such as thin plate splines, and several variations of these schemes. The results include an analysis of cost versus skill; this information is summarized in plots for most combinations.

First, a specific data model for the database system is chosen.  Second, a corresponding model-based data language is then specified.  The result of this traditional approach to the database-system development is a mono-lingual database system where the user sees and uses the database system with a specific data model and its model-based data language.  The conventional practice for the database-system design and implementation mandates that a database system must be restricted tot a single data model and a specific model-based data language.  This paper introduces a new and unconventional approach to the design and implementation of a database system, the multi-lingual database system (MLDS).  The multi-lingual database system is a single database system that can execute many transactions written respectively in different data languages and support many databases structured correspondingly in various data models.  For example, this multi-lingual database system can run DL/I transactions on IMS databases, CODASYL-DML transactions on network database, SQL transactions on relational databases and Daplex transactions on entity-relationship databases, where the system appears to the user like a heterogeneous collection of database systems.  Thus, a multi-lingual database system allows the old transactions and existing databases to be migrated to the new environment, the experienced user to continue to utilize certain favorite features of existing data languages and data models, the new user to explore the strong features of the various data languages and data models, the hardware upgrade to be focused on a single system instead of a heterogeneous collection of database systems, and the database application to cover wider types of transactions and different modes of interactions.",,,,,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 05/15/98;  |akmc/kmc 10/29/09.,,,,, 0|aDatabases.; 0|aDatabase design.; 0|aComputer architecture.,,,,"1 |aHsiao, David K.,|d1933-",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The emergence in the research community and in the commercial world of this kind of database computer (known as the multiple-backed database computers), were each computer system is configured with two or more identical processors and their associated stores for concurrent execution of transactions and for parallel processing of a centralized database spread over separate stores, is evident.  The motivation and characterization of the multiple-backend database computer are first given.  The need and lack of a methodology for benchmarking the new computer with a variable number of backends for the same database or with a fixed number of backends for different capacities are also evident.  The measures (benchmarks) of the new computer are articulated and established and the design of the methodology for conducting the measurements is then given.  Because of the novelty of the database computer architecture, the benchmarking methodology is rather elaborate and somewhat complicated.  To aid our understanding of the methodology, a concrete sample is given herein.  This sample also illustrates the use of the methodology.  Meanwhile, a CAD system which computerizes the benchmarking methodology for systematically assisting the design of test databases and test-transaction mixes, for automatically tallying the design data and workloads, and for completely generating the test databases and test-transaction mixes is being implemented.",,,,,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 05/15/98;  |akmc/kmc 10/29/09.,,,,, 0|aDatabases.; 0|aComputer architecture.,,,,"1 |aHsiao, David K.,|d1933-;1 |aVincent, James R.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The authors have performed a study that compares two major approaches to the improvement of software, software fault elimination and software fault tolerance, by examination of the fault detection obtained by five techniques: run-time assertions, multi-version voting, functional testing augmented by structural testing, code reading by stepwise abstraction, and static data-flow analysis. This study has focused on characterizing the sets of faults detected by the techniques and on characterizing the relationships between these sets of faults. The results of the study show that none of the techniques studied is necessarily redundant to any combination of the others.

In the design study reported here, the authors take a systems engineering  approach to a totally new carrier design which may best suit the requirements for the next      generation aircraft carrier. The central goal was to provide a ship to meet all of the current      mission requirements of the existing Nimitz class carriers but in a platform that is  significantly lower in life cycle costs. The outcome is a ship based on a concept called  ""super-island""; a large island structure that can provides drive-through ""pit- stops"" for  aircraft refueling and rearming as well as other major functions. Other areas of major innovation include: weapons handling, information processing and distribution, engineering layout and manning.

(3) DEPOT: Specification, design, and prototype implementation on a PC base of the framework and initial content of dynamically modifiable servers. The intent is that DEPOT clients and servers would take advantage of platform protected modes where available (e.g., Windows NT, Iron Horse) leading to client-server computing in a network of heterogeneously trusted hosts. As a general facility for installing and managing application ""hooks"" DEPOT incorporates the following key new ideas: (1) the division of sets of hooks by module, (2) the partial ordering of modules, (3) binding hooks to network names, and (4) provision of a run-time model of module behavior with a visible state machine model that abstracts and externalizes the dynamic behavior of that module.

Our antisampling techniques have connections to those of sampling (and have duals in many cases), but they have different advantages and disadvantages, making antisampling sometimes preferable to sampling, sometimes not. In particular, they can only be efficient when data is in a computer, and they exploit computer science ideas such as production systems and database theory.

Our work applies primarily to transformation functions whose derivatives are constant-sign for a positive range (e.g. logarithm, antilog, square root, and reciprocal). With such functions we can often get reasonably tight absolute bounds, so that distributional assumptions about the data needed for confidence intervals can be eliminated. We investigate a variety of methods of obtaining such bounds, first examining bounding curves which are straight lines, them those that are quadratic polynomials. While the problem of finding the best quadratic bound is an optimization problem with no closed-form solution, we display a variety of closed-form quadratic bounds which can come close to the optimal solution. We emphasize what can be done with prior knowledge of the mean and standard deviation of the untransformed data values, but do address some other statistics too.

In many cases the Diophantine equations are linear, allowing efficient algorithmic solution. Probabilistic models can also be used to rank solutions by reasonability, further pruning the search space.

A bound on the approximation error is also developed.  The approximation is derived by a proximal cascade, which sequentially considers      overlapping subsets of the model's time periods, or other ordinally defined set. In turn, we  bound the cascade's deviation from the optimal objective value by a Lagrangian cascade, which uses proximal cascade dual variables to penalize in feasibility. When tested on the  NPS/RAND Mobility Optimizer, a large temporal LP developed for the US Air Force, we  often observe gaps between the approximation and bound of less than 10 percent, and save      as much as 80 percent of the time required to solve the original problem Baker, 1997.

It analyzes and discusses the results of two days of intensive testing at NAWC China Lake on the 9th and 10th of July 1997. These tests were performed to determine the ability of  IMOM to be used as a predictive tool when employed in the role of mission planning. The  genesis of this study was to answer a question that had arisen in comparison of field results  being obtained from the TAMPS modeling and simulation system. It was desired to obtain  flight test data for both TAMPS and IMOM in order to compare their ability to accurately      predict the effects of Radar Terrain Masking (RTM). It was initially planned to have NPS compare predictive data from both of these systems and then do analysis of how they  compared to actual field test data.,  |aAlso available online,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.;  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 09/01/98,,,,, 0|aRadar.; 0|aAerodynamics.,,,,"1 |aBuczynski, Paul.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering.,,,01|aNPS-EC-98-012.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/1998/NPS-EC-98-012.pdf|z(20.60 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA352011,,,"  |aFLIGHT TESTING, ELECTRONIC WARFARE, RADAR, TERRAIN MASKING, SIMULATION, EXPERIMENTAL DATA, MISSION PROFILES, COMPARISON, FIELD TESTS, ACCURACY, NAVAL PLANNING.",,,,

The database is generated non-interactively from available U.S. Geological Survey topographical maps. The database is maintained interactively by a graphics workstation. The focus of this study is on the non-interactive generation of the polygonal database. The non-interactive generation process uses both a set of heuristics derived from the characteristics of paper maps and classical region growing. This study presents a two-phase approach to the digital map production problem. The first phase is a non-interactive phase in which general information is gleaned from a paper topographical map with the use of an image digitizer and computer vision software.

Simulated 500 mb pressure height fields are approximated from first-quess data with spatially correlated errors and observed values having independent errors. It is found that GCV does not allow LSS to adapt to variations in individual realizations, and that specification of a single suitable parameter value for all realizations leads to smaller rms error overall. While the tests were performed in the context of data from a meteorology problem, it is expected the results carry over to data from other sources. A comparison shows that significantly better approximations can be obtained using LSS applied in a unified manner to both first-guess and observed values rather than in a correction to first-guess scheme (as in Optimum Interpolation) when the first-guess error has low spatial correlation.",,,,,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 09/03/98,,,,, 0|aWeather forecasting.; 0|aInterpolation.; 0|aSpline theory.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

They are characterized through teamwork, distribution and the handling of complex data structures (e.g. multimedia data). Object-oriented database systems, providing for complex object management, represent one approach in support of such applications. They concentrate, however, on data modeling aspects and use more or less conventional transaction concepts, based on a global execution control. Hence, they only partially fulfill application requirements as they do not adequately cope with the autonomy that is often inherent to the system's components. As a consequence, we suggest S-transactions as an appropriate means for describing the cooperation of system components in terms of transactions and beyond. In this paper we outline the modeling of conventional transactions (flat or nested as well as distributed and design transactions) in terms of STDL, the S-transaction definition language. Beyond that we point out how to specify SAGAs and similar concepts.

One new direction is the emergence of the multi-lingual database systems where a single database system can execute many transactions written respectively in different data languages and support many databases structured correspondingly in various data models. Thus, a multi-lingual database system allows the old transactions and existing databases to be migrated to the new system, the user to explore the strong features of the various data languages and data models in the same system, the hardware upgrade to be focused on a single system instead of a heterogeneous collection of database systems, and the database application to cover wider types of transactions and interactions in the same environment. One other new direction is the emphasis of the mutli-backend database systems where the database system is configured with a number of microprocessor-based processing units and their disk subsystems. These processing units and disk subsystems are called database backends. The unique characteristics of the backends are that the number of the backends is variable, the system software in all of the backends is identical, and the multiplicity of the backends is proportional to the performance and capacity of the system. Thus, for the first time, a multi-backend database system enables the user to relate the amount of hardware used (i.e., the number of the backends) to the degree of performance gain and capacity growth of the system. The third new direction is the possibility of the multi-host database systems where a single database system can communicate with a variable number and heterogeneous collection of mainframes in several different data languages and allow the mainframes to share the common database store and access. This paper attempts to articulate the background, benefits, requirements and architectures of these new types of database systems, namely, the multi-lingual, the multi-backend, and the multi-host database systems.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 4/15/09.,,,,, 0|aData base management|xComputer programs|xResearch.; 0|aMLDS (Computer system).; 0|aMBDS (Computer system).; 0|aMHDS (Computer system).,,,,"1 |aHsiao, David K.,|d1933-",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aQA76.9.S88|bD45 1985|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768000646582,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

In this problem, it is desired to solve for a control function (which might be thrust magnitude and direction of gimbaled engine) in time in order to minimize time to intercept an enemy missile. Such problems are really infinite dimensional in nature (i.e., determining the control at each time point along the trajectory). However, in using a digital computer to solve such problems, certain operations occur which make the problem discrete and so viewable in a finite dimensional setting. For example, to numerically integrate the differential equations of motion, only values of thrust at a finite number of time points (typically, the beginning of each integration interval) affect the trajectory. The problem then is to determine these values so as to minimize the time to intercept. For any particular trajectory, this quantity is computed through a complicated flight equation simulation model. Also inherent in this computation is noise so that the computed time to intercept is really a noisy quantity. The current algorithm considers the noise in solving for the optimal control.",,,,,,,,  |akmc/kmc 12/2/09.;  |aaq/aq cc:9116 12/10/98,,,,, 0|aTrajectory optimization.; 0|aBallistic missile defenses.,,,,"1 |aBassingthwaighte, J.

More specifically the report is concenred with the question of measuring and summarizing the student's perception of the instructional treatment they received while at NPS. The administration is obliged to monitor this process and MDS offers a dynamic and yet structured way to manage this problem. Moreover, it will be seen that the technique is a subtle one which allows the discovery of new factors that influence the perception process. It has the potential of providing a way to separate unwanted effects. Recent advances in computer input technology make feasible the data collection component that is inherent in the application of the MDS technique. The student may link to a user friendly computer program which will request information of the proper kind. Responses are input by moving the cursor to the proper position and striking an appropriate key. (The use of a touchscreen or a mouse would be even better.) When finished, the respondent can send his input to a central file where it is merged with input from other sources and processed. The use of the console for the administration of a questionnaire allows much information to be gathered in a reasonably short period of time. The type of information requested and the way it is analyzed are the main issues treated herein.

Updated track summaries in each pattern/region combination, and the recurring (more than three) environment structure transitions are provided. Refinements in the set of TC-environment transitional mechanisms in the meteorological knowledge base include: (1) new Equatorial Westerly Wind Burst Mechanism; (2) new semi-direct TC interaction equatorward conceptual model; (3) additional variations of the Subtropical Ridge Modulation mechanisms; and (4) further cases of Vertical Wind Shear leading to dramatic TC track changes.

Design characteristics and systems factors must be addressed to ensure that NBI implementation is handled strategically. Many other innovations in instructional technology have failed because they have not considered the fit between the technology and the learners, tasks, and the organization. These factors should be addressed initially in the design of instruction, and ultimately in beta testing. Recommendations of this research focus on those actions that NBI subject matter experts and systems designers can take to ensure that executives are fully engaged in the learning experience.

The method requires an initial guess at the route, which is then gradually warped into a route that is locally optimal. Application is made to a problem where a submarine wishes to find a route along with minimal qradiated noise will be intercepted by the enemy.  Certain tactical problems take the form of inquiries into the best way of getting from A to B, where A and B are positions in a continuous state space. The optimal route from A to B is not necessarily a straight line: ocean currents or winds may cause a ship to be routed indirectly to take advantage of favorable areas, or certain regions may be threatening (thyphoons, enemy units) or even non-feasible (land). A 'route' being a complicated      mathematical object, it should be expected that the time required for computation of an optimal route will be significant, and that it will be sensitive to the way in which the optimal routing problem is formulated and solved. This technical report describes a somewhat unconventional approach to formulation and solution.

The switching frequency of a hard-switched dc-dc converter is limited by the maximum admissible switching losses allowed by the switch, heat sink, and cooling process. Also, hard- switched converters contribute significant Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) concerns for the system. This study provides a background analysis into resonant converters which utilize zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching techniques to mitigate the aforementioned concerns and facilitate high-bandwidth control loops. In particular, one candidate circuit is identified which can be readily realized using existing hardware and a straightforward control. The report documents the modes of operation of the circuit, sets forth the governing differential equation and mode-transition conditions, examines an ACSL simulation representation of the circuit, formulates design criteria for component selection, identifies key fabrication nuances, and documents a PSpice simulation of the circuit. Both simulation models are used to explain the operating modes of the circuit, provide insight into parameter selection, and ultimately to design the proper control of the circuit.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 04/16/99.,,,,, 0|aElectromagnetic interference.; 4|aBuck chopper.,,,,"1 |aAshton, Robert W.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering.,,,0 |aNPS-EC-99-003.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/1999/NPS-EC-99-003.pdf|z(1.33 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA361136,,,"  |a*ELECTRONIC SWITCHING, ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE, DC TO DC CONVERTERS",,,,

The contents is captured in terms of natural language descriptions and is translated by a parser into predicates for easy matching with query phrases. The implications of this approach are discussed: Data organization for multimedia including contents representation, the dictionary used by the parser to recognize words and assign predicates, rules to use semantic relationships in the query evaluation, and access paths to speed up the search for the descriptions. The result is an architecture for multimedia database management systems that combines the additional components needed with the conventional data management and identifies their ways of interaction. Three types of user interfaces are offered that require different levels of skill.

The theory is carried out for the most general case of a body of arbitrary shape which may extend through the free-surface or be completely immersed. The incident wave evolves in the development as a second-order Stokes' wave. Boundary-value problems are established for both the first- and second-order velocity potentials and a numerical method based on the Green's function is outlined. The determination of forces exerted by gravity waves on large structures immersed in the sea has become of great practical interest in recent years. for example, in the design of bottom-mounted oil storage facilities or large ocean caissons, the wave-induced horizontal and up-lift forces and overturning moments are factors of primary importance. The effect of large amplitude waves in particular is of importance in the determination of the permanence of an ocean structure and, therefore, a higher-order theory appears to have significant practical value. For example, Apelt and Macknight (1976) found measured forces on a ocean caisson model in fairly large-amplitude shallow-water waves to be considerably in excess of calculations based on linear diffraction theory.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 6/2/09.,,,,, 0|aGravity waves.; 0|aOffshore structures|xHydrodynamics.; 0|aGreen's functions.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aQA927|b.G265|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768000415640,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Quick estimates of statistics rather than exact values are becoming increasingly important to analysts. The author proposes a new technique for estimating statistics on a database, a top-down alternative to the bottom-up method of sampling. This approach precomputes a set of general-purpose statistics on the database, a database abstract, and then uses a large set of inference rules to make bounded estimates of other, arbitrary statistics requested by users. The inference rules form a new example of an artificial-intelligence expert system. There are several important advantages of this approach over sampling methods.

These projections in turn are passed to a program which is designed to maintain the Army's strength as closely as possible to prescribed levels. These projections are based on characteristic groups, a set of sub-groups of recruits who are similar in terms of sex, education level, term of service and mental category; the presumption has been that attrition rates ought to be different between groups. However in recent years ELIM projections have been unsatisfactory. This study used Classification and Regression Tree methodology (CART) to generate improved c-groups for predicting not only first-term attrition but also early-term behavior and re-enlistment. The most important variables by which to create these groups turn out to be race and gender.

Turbojet exhaust dispersion characteristics, simulated by a burner/nozzle system, were investigated by measuring the horizontal and vertical temperature profiles at axial stations downwind from the nozzle exit. Dispersion sensitivity to different nozzle exit conditions, angles of incidence to the wind, and nozzle surface blockage were investigated. The results were compared to dispersion methods used in the Air Quality Assessment Model (AQAM). It was found that (1) the experimental jet penetration length was much shorter than that assumed in AQAM, (2) the horizontal jet exhibited plume rise, (3) the initial dispersion coefficients were a function of wind direction, and (4) the plume spreading rate was more rapid than for the low velocity, elevated sources in neutrally stable atmospheric conditions.

One commonly used technique is to identify and then to exploit in a basis factorization algorithm a generalized upper bound (GUB) structure. This report compares several existing methods for identifying GUB structure. Computer programs have been written to permit comparison of computational efficiency. The GUB programs have been incorporated in an existing optimization system of advanced design and have been tested on a variety of large scale real life optimization problems. The identification of GUB sets of maximum size is shown to be among the class of NP-complete problems; these problems are widely conjectured to be intractable in that no polynomial-time algorithm has been demonstrated for solving them. All the methods discussed in this report are polynomial-time heuristic algorithms that attempt to find, but do not guarantee, GUB sets of maximum size. Bounds for the maximum size of GUB sets are developed, in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the heuristic algorithms.

From a central facility, refined petroleum products valued at more than 10 billion dollars per year are dispatched from more than 80 bulk terminals on a fleet exceeding 300 vehicles in approximately 2600 loads per day. Design, implementation and use of the central dispatch routines are discussed from the perspective of transaction modules within a large management information system.

A branch and bound procedure, which imposes a tree structure on the search, is often the most efficient known means for solving these problems.  While for some branch and bound algorithms a worst case complexity bound is known, the average case complexity is usually unknown despite the fact that it gives more information about the performance of the algorithm.  In this dissertation the branch and bound method is discussed and a proabilistic model of its domain is given, namely a class of trees with an associated probability measure.  The best bound first and depth-first search strategies are discusses and results on the expected time and space complexity of these strategies are presented and compared.  The best-bound search strategy is shown to be optimal in both time and space.  These results are illustrated by data from random traveling salesman problems.  Evidence is presented which suggests that the asymmetric traveling salesman problem can be solved exactly in time O(np3slnp2s(n)) on the",,,,,,,,,,,,, 0|aCombinatorial optimization.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aQA164|b.S66|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768000416010,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The indications and characteristics of these frequently recurring error mechanisms in the forecast tracks and fields of the models are thoroughly documented and one or more illustrative case studies are provided for each error mechanism. This documentation is organized into a 5 level preliminary Model Traits Knowledge Base for use by TC forecasters when applying the Systematic Approach to formulate the official track forecast.

Previous workshops have been devoted to ""Real-Time & Concurrent Systems"", ""Software Merging and Slicing"", ""Software Evolution"", ""Software Architecture"", and ""Requirements Targeting Software"". A major goal for this series of workshops is to help focus the software engineering community on issues that are vital to improving the state of software engineering practice. This focus promotes consistency among diverse research directions that address different aspects of the same problem to facilitate future integration efforts. The workshop represents a bridge between industry and academia. The material in these proceedings presents a balanced view of academic and industrial developments. Formalization is fundamental to the development of software engineering as an engineering discipline. The critical importance of formal models and form al methods is painfully clear when one considers the escalating demands for larger, more complex, reliable software Systems.",  |aAlso available online,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,,,,,, 4|aReal-time.; 0|aComputer programming.; 0|aComputer software.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of.

This report is concerned with the general problem of allocating the different types of jobs among the several classes of manpower. The report describes a model that constructs a personnel inventory by rank for each of several manpower classes (pilots, etc.) and then allocates those people to the specialized and common jobs that they are allowed to do. The idea of the model is to allow a policy maker to quickly reconcile billet requirements with the reality of available accessions, job sharing targets between classes, and continuation rates of the different manpower classes. Different allocations can be produced either by assuming the values of a few key variables, or they can be generated using an optimization scheme that sets 'allowable' percentage errors. Four optimization variants based on this idea are described.

Static and dynamic data from the Precision Lightweight GPS receiver (PLGR) were used to analyze the error characteristics and design an averaging technique for dynamic conditions. It was found that the errors in PPS solutions are dominated by the satellite broadcast ephemeris parameters. The solution errors are highly correlated for a given set of satellites/ephemeris. The variation can be as low as 0.4 m in dynamic conditions, but a slowly changing ""bias"" of several meters is also present. For fitting the location of a road observed repeatedly with a PPS receiver a technique based on ""space curves"" was developed. Here the solutions are transformed from functions of time to functions of space (location). These then are used. Curves could be fit with a Bezier polynomial easily to the 0.4 m level. These analytic curves were then used to form an ensemble average. The bias vectors between the solutions were found with least squares estimation.

A new AUV is being constructed in order to increase the vehicle's mission capabilities. Despite its autonomy, the AUV needs to have the mission plan defined before starting. For that purpose, a text file containing a mission script is sent to the computer inside the robot. However, the file syntax is very precise and, thus, this approach to generating missions can be unsafe because it is easy to include typing errors in the text file. This project explains the creation of a Graphic User Interface (GUI) used to automatically generate the text file. Visual Prolog is used to realize such an interface, offering capabilities to simplify the writing of the Prolog code. The results of this work is a GUI that eliminates typing incorrect commands, provides a visualization of the commanded trajectory, and checks the syntax of the text. In this way, users can easily, quickly and safely build the mission plan.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 10/29/99,,,,, 0|aCybernetics.; 0|aUnderwater navigation.; 0|aNavigation |xsatellites.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Mechanical Engineering.,,,01|aNPS-ME-99-005.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/1999/NPS-ME-99-005.pdf|z(6.15 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA369172,,,"  |a*UNDERWATER VEHICLES, *AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION, *GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE, ROBOTS, GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM, NAVIGATION SATELLITES, UNDERWATER NAVIGATION, VIRTUAL REALITY.",,,,

The new boat will use a 48 volts batteries pack. Moreover, some components will be replaced or removed for the new configuration (camera, acoustic modem, etc...). All this change requires designing a new power bus to give electric power in all the boat. Described in this project is the adaptation of all the Phoenix's components to this new power bus. This adaptation included the choice of new components and the design of the new power bus that will provide energy in the new boat.

The focus of this phase of the project is the development of an improved solution algorithm for fast transient analysis of large, locally nonlinear structures using time domain structural synthesis. The report documents the development of several algorithms intended to improve upon the original algorithm developed by the first author. The last algorithm developed meets the stated goals of the project. This algorithm is a newly developed recursive, block by block convolution solution to the governing nonlinear integral equation. As is demonstrated with a realistically large nonlinear base excitation problem (51, 300 DOF finite element model), the new algorithm provides a 78% reduction in time required for the nonlinear transient base excitation solution, as compared with traditional direct integration. The new algorithm provides an even greater reduction in computer time for subsequent analysis. The nonlinear base isolation solutions calculated using the new algorithm take approximately 7 seconds, as compared with the direct integration solution which takes approximately 30 minutes. The rapid reanalysis capability will facilitate the development of numerical optimization for the design of nonlinear isolation. The theory of transient synthesis is documented, along with a new proof of the exponential convergence properties of an iterative solution to the governing nonlinear integral equation.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 01/18/00,,,,, 0|aStructural dynamics|xMathematical models.; 0|aEarthquake resistant design|xMathematical models.; 0|aNonlinear integral solutions|xNumerical solutions.,,,,"1 |aNeta, Beny.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of  Mechanical Engineering.,,,0 |aNPS-ME-99-009.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/1999/NPS-ME-99-009.pdf|z(1.54 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA371849,,,"  |a*COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION, *STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS, *EARTHQUAKES, ALGORITHMS, FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS, INTEGRAL EQUATIONS, TIME DOMAIN, STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY",,,,

The impact of exponential deadlines, either behavioral or server controlled, is represented using both a modification of the Takacs Benes integro differential equation, and a simple and accurate fixed point approximation.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 01/18/00,,,,, 0|aStochastic processes.; 0|aCommand and control systems.,,,,"1 |aJacobs, Patricia A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Operations Research.,,,01|aNPS-OR-00-001.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2000/NPS-OR-00-001.pdf|z(1.16 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA370729,,,"  |a*STOCHASTIC PROCESSES, *SYSTEMS ANALYSIS, *DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS, QUEUEING THEORY, DECISION MAKING, DISTRIBUTED DATA PROCESSING, COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS.",,,,

The ship described would meet test needs for future weapons and sensor systems and provide limited test capability for future hull, mechanical and electrical systems. The current Self Defense Test Ship is over 45 years old, approaching the end of its useful life. A conversion of a decommissioned SPRUANCE (DD 963) class ship is the basis for the replacement Surface Warfare Test Ship. The study proceeds from mission needs and operational requirements through a functional analysis and study of threat weapons to be employed against the SWTS. After summarizing the characteristics of a SPRUANCE Class ship, the study reports an analysis of four alternative conversion schemes. The alternatives are described, with the rationale for choosing that considered best. The chosen alternative is then described and analyzed in several important areas of concern including combat systems functionality, signature characteristics, engineering plant and habitability for test personnel. The fitness of the proposed design for several special evolutions is also described, and alternatives for further enhancing performance are presented.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 04/28/00,,,,, 0|aMarine engineering.; 0|aShip models.; 0|aSystems engineering.,,,,"1 |aHarney, Robert C.;1 |aWickersham, David.;1 |aFarsaris, Ioannis.;1 |aMalone, Philip.;1 |aRuley, David.;1 |aYork, Nathan.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Mechanical Engineering.,,,01|aNPS-ME-00-001.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2000/NPS-ME-00-001.pdf;41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA374332,,,"  |aTEST AND EVALUATION, SHIP MODELS, DESTROYERS, CONVERSION, SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, NAVAL VESSELS, THREATS, OPERATIONAL READINESS, WEAPON SYSTEMS, TEST EQUIPMENT, DESIGN CRITERIA, NAVAL ARCHITECTURE, SHIP HULLS, ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE, ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, MECHANICAL COMPONENTS, HABITABILITY.",,,,

The DIS has a digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) and associated circuitry, including digital tapped delay lines and a modulator in each delay line to impose both amplitude and frequency modulation in each line. A unique property of the digital image synthesizer is its ability to synthesize false targets using wideband chirp signals of any duration. To generate the target, the user can program the target extent (number of taps) and the amplitude and Doppler frequency of each range Doppler cell within the image. The system on a chip uses a scalable CMOS technology that increases the bandwidth and sensitivity of such a repeater over prior analog based systems. The application specific integrated circuit reduces the noise of the repeated signal, reduces the size and cost of such a system, and permits real time alteration of operating parameters, permitting rapid and adaptive shifting among different types of targets to be synthesized.

We provide a discussion and examples of user- specified security variables and show how the range of service levels associated with these variables can support the provision of Quality of Security Service. We also discuss various design implications regarding security ranges provided in a QoS-aware distributed system. Our goal has been to provide an understanding of QoSS and variant security, and to determine whether these concepts can be useful in improving security service and system performance in QoS-aware distributed systems. We described the general requirements for system attributes to participate in the provision of Quality of Service, and described how certain security attributes might meet these requirements. We then described various forms of user and application security ""ranges ""and showed how these ranges can make sense in relation to existing security policies, when those ranges are presented as user choices.

Our conclusion is that it may be possible for security to be a semantically meaningful dimension of Quality of Service without compromising existing security policies.

A major disadvantage of aggregated data is that the district is not the primary level at which resources are allocated or recruiting activities occur. Rather, recruiters are assigned to stations and each station is responsible for a set of zip codes, which define its market territory. Thus, existing research does not provide information that would assist in identifying the best geographic areas in which to locate recruiters or stations. This paper exploits a unique data file constructed from the basic building blocks of recruiting markets - zip codes. This paper aims to measure the effects of geographic location, especially of recruiters and stations, on enlistment supply for the Navy and Army.

The system integrates an access database, a GAMS optimizer, and MapInfo graphics to provide a flexible environment to maximize production through market analysis and demographic information. This research uses RSLES to analyze three different stationing scenarios. Each scenario is applied in a selected sample of 39 U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA).

A parametric study was undertaken to determine the essential components of the model. The results from this investigation determined that the path of force propagation from a body armor system to the thorax upon bullet impact is directly through the vest to the sternum and then through the skeleton to the rest of the body.

Previous network policy languages vary from the very specific, using packet filters at the bit level, to the more abstract where concepts are represented, with implementation details left up to individual network devices. As background information a policy framework model and policy- based routing protocols are discussed. PPL's path-based approach for representing network policies is advantageous in that Quality of Service (QoS) and security policies can be associated with an explicit path through the network. This assignment of policies to network flows aids in new initiatives such as Integrated Services. The more stringent requirement of supporting path- based policies can be easily relaxed with the use of wild card characters to also support Differentiated Services and best-effort service, which is provided by the Internet today.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 09/14/00.,,,,, 0|aComputer programming.; 0|aComputer software.; 0|aComputer programming |xlanguages.; 0|aComputer networks.,,,,"1 |aLundy, Bert.;1 |aXie, Geoffrey.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Computer Science.,,,01|aNPS-CS-00-003.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2000/NPS-CS-00-003.pdf.pdf;41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA381775,,,"  |aPOLICIES, PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, NETWORK ANALYSIS (MANAGEMENT), COMPUTER NETWORKS, NETWORK FLOWS, COMPUTER PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION, DATA PROCESSING SECURITY, ROUTING, CONTROL SEQUENCES, COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS.",,,,

AUVs are principally designed to realize reconnaissance missions. To achieve such tasks, they usually utilize precise range-based sonars. Unfortunately, sonars are often unable to provide a good and efficient description of their environment due to the unclear aspect of many sonar images. To overcome such problems, the ARIES vehicle has a video camera to obtain understandable, classifiable images. This project explains the design of the video system installed on the ARIES AUV. The video system allows the AUV to automatically record and to easily understand the images provide by the AUV's camera. In this way, the AUV is now an efficient ""witness"" of its surroundings. This project then describes how to utilize the video for vehicle navigation. Such a capability is demonstrated by the simulation of the recovery between an AUV and a host submarine, using an underwater beacon and a light-tracking system. These results show that the use of in-water video for contact recording and navigational tracking can be practical and effective.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 09/14/00.,,,,, 4|aAutonomous underwater vehicle.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Mechanical Engineering.,,,0 |aNPS-ME-00-003.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2000/NPS-ME-00-003.pdf|z(2.62 MB),,,"  |aUNDERWATER VEHICLES, TRACKING, VIDEO RECORDING, RECOVERY, EFFICIENCY, MISSIONS, CAMERAS, SELF OPERATION, LEADING EDGES, AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION, VIDEO SIGNALS, SUBMARINES, RECONNAISSANCE, SONAR IMAGES",,,,

DOD is concerned with identifying the most cost- effective geographic locations for the Services recruiting offices. This report provides an overview of the Recruiting Station Location Project undertaken for the Assistant Secretary of Defense (FMP), Office of Accession Policy. The project developed models to assess the costs and benefits of alternative geographic locations for recruiting offices. The model is contained in the Recruiting Station Location Evaluation System (RSLES), which combines extensive ZIP code level data bases with an optimization routine and a geographic mapping capability. RSLES chooses optimal geographic locations for recruiting offices by balancing the impact of pre-specified ZIP code locations on costs and on new contract production. The report summarizes the components of the RSLES system. These include: the data bases of ZIP code level contracts and other demographic attributes; boundary files for all U.S. ZIP codes and ZIP code address of recruiting offices; econometric cost and contract production models; and, the optimization and mapping software. The report also details the architecture of the RSLES system and the integrating shell. Finally, the report describes efforts to apply and validate the RSLES system using data on Navy stationing actions in FY99 and FY00. The applications identify significant improvements in production that could be achieved by application of the RLSES model.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 11/29/00.,,,,,,,,,"1 |aGue, Kevin R.;1 |aHogan, Paul F.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Systems Management.,,,01|aNPS-SM-00-009.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2000/NPS-SM-00-009.pdf|z(0.68 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA382313,,,"  |a*STATIONS, *MILITARY FACILITIES, DATA BASES, POSITION(LOCATION), DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, OPTIMIZATION, COST EFFECTIVENESS, RECRUITING, DEMOGRAPHY, COST ESTIMATES.",,,,

Under a concept of interoperability that is based on competition among interfacing systems for reporting responsibility on tracks, the least performing system can degrade the performance of the entire family. A program of interoperability testing must therefore emphasize operability in addition to conformance to message standards. This report examines interoperability testing of a TMD FoS from perspectives ranging from the statistical validity of tracking algorithms to the integrity of track messaging. Recommendations for extending interoperability testing in these areas are made. Testing should be conducted in a manner that focuses attention on deficiencies in both the concept and operations of a TMD FoS. In particular, interoperability testing should be structured to demonstrate the effects of system-level registration errors (bias) on FoS operations. A three-tiered 'test, registration, re-test' procedure can satisfy this objective with minimal disruption to testing under current (TADIL J) message standards.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 11/29/00.,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Operations Research.,,,0 |aNPS-OR-01-001.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2001/NPS-OR-01-001.pdf;41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA384703,,,"  |a*THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE, TEST AND EVALUATION, ALGORITHMS, VALIDATION, INTEROPERABILITY, TEST METHODS, TRACKING, DEFICIENCIES, STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, GUIDED MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, MESSAGE PROCESSING",,,,

We provide models that evaluate the ""testing as learning and improving"" paradigm: the models describe the effect of end-to-end or linked-stage testing, and defect identification and removal, on field or delivered-system reliability. A major concern is the evaluation of operating characteristics of such test designs as the ""first run of r total system successes (e.g. 3)"" stopping rule. The models include Bayesian formulations in which the unknown number of defects in each subsystem at any stage during testing is a random variable with known distribution.

It emphasizes simple low-resolution representations of the products of generic imaging sensors. Later work will deal with other input, such as ELINT and COMINT. We provide ideas as to how such information products can be combined or fused, basically using a Bayesian and Gaussian/Normal-distribution theory format for computational and conceptual convenience.

The general approach of this analysis methodology is to focus on a specific experimental initiative from one or more FBEs, such as Time Critical Targeting (TCT). BAT/IW models are then tailored to the experimental situation using actual data obtained from one or more experiments and the experiment systems architecture.  After the models and actual data are reconciled, further analysis tasks are undertaken, such as predictions of the effects of attack intensity, and/or of C4ISR response time reduction. BAT/IW modeling helps analyze and understand the system-level impact of sensor data quality, including timeliness, as one contributor to total operation/campaign success.  BAT/IW modeling also accounts for the latency involved in processing information, including communications delays, decision time, waiting, etc.  An example is developed to show how operational data obtained during FBE Foxtrot can be quantitatively analyzed to indicate important sensitivities.""--Report documentation page.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adln/dk cc:9116. 01/24/01.,,,,, 0|aInformation warfare.; 0|aDecision making.; 0|aOperations research.; 0|aArchitecture.,,,,"1 |aJacobs, Patricia A.;1 |aPilnick, Steven E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.):|bInstitute for Joint Warfare Analysis.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2001/NPS-IJWA-01-008.pdf|z(0.63 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA385288,,,"  |aCOMMAND CONTROL COMMUNICATIONS, INFORMATION PROCESSING, INFORMATION WARFARE, QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, DETECTORS, DECISION MAKING, DATA MANAGEMENT, ATTACK, INTENSITY, TIME, QUALITY, DELAY, COMMUNICATION AND RADIO SYSTEMS, TARGETING, OPERATIONS RESEARCH, TIMELINESS, ARCHITECTURE, BATTLES.",,,,

Each of these conceptual models describes how the dynamical model incorrectly predicts a known physical cause of tropical cyclone motion. Midlatitude circulation-related error sources occur more frequently in the Southern Hemisphere, which is as expected since deeply penetrating midlatitude trough-ridge circulations have more of an effect on tropical cyclone motion. In addition to erroneous predictions of midlatitude cyclogenesis and anticyclogenesis, the dynamical models error in their response to midlatitude vertical wind shear and baroclinic cyclone interactions with the tropical cyclones. One frequently occurring tropical-related large track-error mechanism is Excessive-Direct Cyclone Interaction, which occurs for similar reasons in the Southern Hemisphere as in the western North Pacific study of Carr and Elsberry.

One possible solution to counter this threat is the use of a high-energy laser to destroy the missiles in flight. The Free Electron Laser is possibly the best choice of lasers for a marine environment since its wavelength can be changed over a wide range allowing the operator to choose the best wavelength to transmit through the atmosphere. Material damage studies on various anti-ship cruise missile materials were carried out at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) in Newport News, Virginia. Experimental procedures presented in this report allow a scaled down laser of a few hundred to a few thousand watts to evaluate the damage from a weapon size laser of the megawatt class. The EEL beam bombards the target with a steady stream of picosecond length pulses at rates of 18MHz or greater. No other experiments have previously been done to explore the effects of the EEL pulse on materials. This report contains the work of several theses conducted at the Naval Postgraduate School over the past two years, and has been a productive cooperation among NPS, TJNAF, NRL, and NSWD at Port Hueneme, to the benefit of the Department of Defense.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 01/29/01,,,,, 0|aFree electron lasers.; 0|aCruise missiles.; 0|aLasers.; 0|aMasers.,,,,"1 |aThomson, R.

That study developed an operational methodology for quantifying these benefits. Drawing on that methodology, significant economic benefits were found associated with naval crisis response in the Arabian Gulf. The current study expands the QDR97 effort in several important directions. First, event analysis is introduced to link naval crisis response with price movements in key commodity, exchange, and share markets. Second, several new cases, one not directly involving oil, are developed to assess the generality of our findings. The findings of the first study are confirmed with naval forward presence/crisis response shown to produce extensive economic benefits for the US economy in each of the cases examined. Taken together, the two studies suggest that the economic benefits associated with naval forward presence/crisis response occur in a wide variety of crisis situations and geographical locations. More importantly, increased globalization together with the revival of tight oil markets will, for the foreseeable future, only reinforce the economic contributions made by forwardly deployed forces.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 01/29/01,,10|aUnited States.|bNavy|xOperational readiness|xEconomic aspects.,,, 0|aSea-power|zUnited States|xEconomic aspects.; 0|aNational security|xEconomic aspects|zUnited States.; 0|aWorld politics|y20th century.; 0|aEconometrics.,,,,"1 |aSchrady, David A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Operations Research.,,,0 |aNPS-OR-01-004.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2001/NPS-OR-01-004.pdf|z(2.01 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA385134,,,"  |a*ECONOMETRICS, METHODOLOGY, CRISIS MANAGEMENT, NAVAL OPERATIONS, NAVAL PLANNING, BENEFITS",,,,

Amongst the ideas they are considering are innovative special purpose littoral warfare platforms as well as alternative relationships between platforms, sensors, weapons and information.  This thesis presents a low-resolution model for analysis of Navy After Next concepts and demonstrates the potential use of the model.  Presented is an adaptation of the existing Hughes Salvo Model which had been limited to analysis of engagements between forces composed of identical units, i.e., homogeneous forces.  This heterogeneous extension is an analytical device that captures the unique combat characteristics of individual units.  The model helps  decision makers understand salvo warfare of heterogenous forces by simplifying the complex relationships within and between forces during battle.  Using a previous work that tested Hughes' model, the accuracy of this heterogeneous salvo model is examined by comparing results.  This thesis further demonstrates the strength of the heterogeneous salvo model through an analysis of a hypothetical campaign scenario and through an examination of alternative tactics.""--Report documentation page.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adln/dk cc:9116. 02/08/01.,,,,, 0|aNaval tactics |x Computer simulation.; 0|aNaval battles |x Computer simulation.; 0|aSurface-to-surface missiles.; 0|aNaval gunnery.,,,,"1 |aPilnick, Steven E.;1 |aHughes, Wayne P.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.):|bInstitute for Joint Warfare Analysis.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2001/NPS-IJWA-01-010.pdf|z(1.03 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA386434,,,"  |a*NAVAL PLANNING, *DEFENSE IN DEPTH, DECISION MAKING, STRATEGIC ANALYSIS, NAVAL WARFARE, SALVOS.",,,,

The simulation is used to determine the optimum distributed C2W/EA configuration of assets including placement of sensors and system selection (jammer or receiver or both) for important mission scenarios leading to a better understanding of the minimum requirements for suppression of enemy air defense operations. ARES is a pulse level simulation that models the complex interaction of multiple radar systems being acted upon by multiple AEA aircraft, considering target aircraft radar cross section (RCS) and altitude, terrain masking effects, both standoff jamming and self protection jamming effects, and network connection effect. Its features include an object%-oriented scenario workbook allowing the users to build a battlefield scenario and a search procedure based on a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimizing configurations of what the core and peripheral components of the AEA architecture should be. ARES is available in two forms: Graphical User Interface (GUI) and parallel. ARES' GUI runs on a personal computer (PC) and its primary application is for setting up scenarios and post processing.

This report represents a synopsis of their findings integrated over all of their visits. Three major roles for METOC regional centers and facilities are identified: (1) to be a source of local METOC knowledge and expertise for their area of responsibility, including familiarity with mesoscale circulations and all reliable sources of real-time data and model output; (2) to provide operational support to the fleet, including customized fused products and littoral oceanography products; and (3) to provide training for METOC personnel in regional-specific meteorology and oceanography, and continuing advanced technical training. A major finding is that technical education and training is inadequate to allow METOC personnel to take maximum advantage of the full range of data, models, and tactical decision aids available to them.

A hierarchical tree-based classification approach is selected as it leads to a relatively simple overall scheme with few parameters needed to differentiate between the various modulation types. Back-propagation neural network units are adopted at each tree node because they offer the flexibility needed to cope with varying propagation environments, as is the case in real-world communications. The selection of robust and well-defined higher-order statistics-based class features is considered and a small number of cumulates and moments chosen to differentiate between all various types of modulation types, except for specific M-QAM types. Simulations show that M-QAM types may be so affected by multipath and fading that higher-order statistic parameters become of very limited use. While being part of the hierarchical procedure, the identification of specific M-QAM types is conducted via equalization algorithms. Extensive simulations show overall classification performances to be strongly affected by the amount of multipath distortion and noise in the transmission channels. Results also show a much higher sensitivity of high-order M-QAM types to fading and multipath propagation distortions than other modulation types.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 06/18/01,,,,, 0|aComputer software.; 0|aComputer programming.; 0|aAlgorithms.; 0|aElectromagnetic waves.,,,,"1 |aHatzichristos, G.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept.

However, this step often leads to high-dimensional feature spaces, which requires large datasets to create viable classification schemes. As a result, there is a strong incentive to reduce the feature space dimension. Two classical types of approaches to reduce feature dimension exist Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based or discriminant-based approaches. The main difference between the two types lies in the criterion selected; PCA-based schemes seek a projection direction which bests represents the data in a norm sense, while discriminant-based schemes seek a projection that best separates the class data. This study presents a comparison of three discriminant-based feature dimension reduction schemes: the Mean Separator Neural Network (MSNN), the Mahalanobis-based Dimension Reduction scheme (MBDR), and the kernel-based Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA) approach. PCA is included for comparison purposes as it is also widely used in classification applications. All four feature dimension reduction schemes are implemented and evaluated by applying the transformed features to a basic minimum distance classifier. Three classification datasets commonly used in statistics for benchmarking purposes are selected to compare the schemes and results discussed Results show the kernel-based generalized discriminant analysis approach to lead to consistently higher classification performances than the other schemes considered in the study for the data investigated.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 08/03/01,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Electrical and Cumputer Engineering.,,,01|aNPS-EC-01-005.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2001/NPS-EC-01-005.pdf|z;41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA391804,,,"  |a*DATA BASES, *CLASSIFICATION, NEURAL NETS, SIZES(DIMENSIONS), REDUCTION, VIABILITY, MEAN, DISCRIMINATION, DISCRIMINATE ANALYSIS.",,,,

Without such basic understanding, one cannot expect to design effective systems and processes for network-centric warfare. The basic research program proposed here addresses this deficiency directly through its three-pronged technical approach: (1) develop and refine a model of knowledge-flow theory, emphasizing the very-large enterprise (e.g., Navy, Department of Defense); (2) develop a contingency model for matching the most appropriate process and system designs to enterprise knowledge-flow patterns; (3) assess the performance effects of alternative knowledge systems and processes through simulation (e.g., of naval warfare, personnel processes). Informed by the basic science of knowledge-flow theory, this work can propel knowledge management toward the methods and tools commonly used for engineering work-a quantum shift from the current state of affairs. This basic research also directly supports ongoing, priority ONR projects (e.g., Sailor-21, advanced command and control, artificially-intelligent systems and decision aids) and should contribute to development of network-centric warfare concepts, systems and operations.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 08/03/01,,,,, 0|aOperations research.; 0|aKnowledge management.; 0|aNaval research.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,01|aNPS-GSBPP-01-003.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2001//NPS-GSBPP-01-003.pdf|z;41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA391841,,,"  |a*KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, DATA BASES, INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, NAVAL RESEARCH, EXPERT SYSTEMS, SYSTEMS APPROACH, BUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING.",,,,

These studies are based upon quarterly and monthly average on board (AOB) data, which provided the period averages for numerous categories of dead time and non-dead time. Data of this type are readily accessible. It has been suggested that a different data structure (i.e., longitudinal data, which records the time spent by sailors in the various categories measured from the beginning of the courses), would provide sharper information about what is happening and help to better understand the nature of the problems, their relative importance, and suggest types of remedial action. The present report presents some models of the longitudinal type and fits them to data. Specifically, it treats the holding time distributions measured from the beginning of a course until the entrance into a non-training state for academic attritions, academic setbacks, and interrupted instruction of the non-legal holiday type. Analysis shows that there is considerable variability of these distributions from course to course and year to year.

The model's emphasis is on suitability issues such as Operational Availability in an on-land (after ocean transit) mission region. The model predicts strong sensitivity to the form of an assumed distribution of times to vehicle breakdown, and hence recommends that appropriate test data be obtained to reveal that form (the mean alone is inadequate). Removal of design faults likely to cause early failures is encouraged. The AAAV design is for a relatively lightweight but technologically advanced (mobile and lethal) amphibious vehicle that operates in platoons. If individual vehicles break down they must often be transported for repair, for example, to their point of origin, a ship. One option is to allow another platoon member to tow; another is to assign an auxiliary vehicle to transport. Such duties may seriously diminish the platoon productive mission availability (the towing/transport agents may themselves fail). OT&E should be designed to fully test for the system-wide effect of force (platoon, and beyond) sustainability requirements.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 08/03/01,,,,,,,,,"1 |aJacobs, Patricia A.;1 |aKemp, Jesse A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Operations Research.,,,0 |aNPS-OR-01-009.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2001/NPS-OR-01-009.pdf;41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA392646,,,"  |aAMPHIBIOUS VEHICLES, TEST AND EVALUATION, MAINTAINABILITY, RELIABILITY, NAVAL PLANNING",,,,

As we transform to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century, leadership can strengthen the foundation of mutual trust and respect among the ranks and the organization as a whole. Most people who equate leadership with good management model their leadership practices based on readings and research published in the industrial era of the twentieth century.

The technique provides an estimate of the cloud-top height of stratocumulus clouds in the marine boundary layer for the area viewed by a polar orbiting weather satellite.  The top of the marine boundary layer is the optimum coupling height for elevated ducts.  Knowledge of the elevated duct height over the tactical battlespace is quite important.  The SMDH technique is one component of a potential shipboard operational system to provide estimates of elevated duct height.  The SMDH technique is verified using NOAA AVHRR satellite data and coincident rawinsonde or aircraft measurements from the 1987 FIRE and 1994 MAST data sets. The SMDH technique, which uses an empirical relationship to relate the satellite cloud-top temperature, sea-surface temperature and cloud-top height, is quite useful.  There are advantages to using a physically-based model, rather than an empirical equation, to estimate cloud-top height.  Some of these advantages are demonstrated using the Naval Postgraduate School's physically-based model with the FIRE and MAST data sets. Conclusions/recommendations include (1) the automation of a cloud-top estimation technique is achievable and development should continue, (2) use a physically-based model, rather than an empirical equation, as the core component of the cloud-top height estimation process.",  |aAlso Available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader required.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 10/02/01.,,,,, 0|aMeteorological satellites.; 0|aClouds.; 0|aMeteorology.,,,,"1 |aDurkee, Philip A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Meteorology.,,,01|aNPS-MR-01-001.,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA395269,,,"  |a*METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITES, *CLOUD HEIGHT INDICATORS, CLOUDS, VERIFICATION, VALIDATION, ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE, BOUNDARY LAYER, DUCTS, EVAPORATION.",,,,

Observation of human behavior during driving suggests that this activity involves two distinct levels, the conscious and the unconscious. Conscious actions relate to the logical behavior of a driver such as stopping the vehicle when a traffic light is red, slowing down the vehicle when it turns a bend, etc. Such behavior can be described using natural human language. The unconscious actions of a driver are much less obvious. There are many such activities occurring while we are driving a vehicle to a particular destination. One of the important unconscious efforts involves the selection of successive points on the road to steer the vehicle towards in order to achieve the desired road-following behavior. This research work attempts to mimic this unconscious behavior through the use of a computer simulation model. Keywords: Robotics; Artificial intelligence; Mobile; Mathematical models.

The wire used is 0.625 micrometers diameter, 90 per cent platinum/10 per cent rhodium, plated with 30-40 micrometers diameter of silver. For construction, the plated wire is first bent into the appropriate shape, and then soldered onto stainless steel prongs. Portions of the silver are then etched, removing it entirely from a 200 mm-400 mm length of platinum/rhodium wire. Small portions of copper plating are then added to give the disired platinum/rhodium wire sensing length, and to insure that good mechanical and electrical connections exist to the sensor. With this procedure, subminiature hot wire sensors have been constructed which operatewith minimal drift, and are mechanically robust for long periods of time. The sensors have been demonstrated to be a useful research tool for turbulence research because they provide a more accurate means to measure energy levels of small-scale turbulent motions than is possible with other measurement devices.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 4/15/09.,,,,00|aFluid mechanics research., 0|aEngineering instruments|xDesign and construction.; 0|aDetectors|xDesign and construction.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,0 |aNPS-69-84-010.,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aTA165|b.L54 1984|s1|tnorm|c00001|u00001 |i32768000726269,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Communication systems, power generation and transmission, and vehicular transportation systems tend to fall into this category. We propose a reliability growth model for such systems that is based on design defect removal under a Test-Fix-Test (TFT) protocol: a system is assembled and put under test, for example for a fixed mission time, or multiple thereof. If the system fails during the test time its failure source in some stage is diagnosed, the stage is re-designed, and the new prototype system reassembled (system design is 'fixed') and the system is re-tested. The test (TFT) process is repeated until a pre- determined test period elapses with no failures. This is analogous to the run- test criteria analyzed for one-shot devices 1. In this model we also allow for occasional defective re-design: response to a test failure can actually (and realistically) increase the number of failure-generating design defects. Our model allows quick numerical assessment of TFT operating characteristics, given defining parameter values.

This work investigated the first 32 algorithms on the JNLWD V&V Priority List. It evaluated JCATS algorithms in two ways: (1) verification of computer code against algorithm documentation, and (2) appropriateness of algorithms within context of U.S. Army current model standards. All 32 algorithms were verified, with very few discrepancies with the documentation being found. Of these 32 algorithms, only 25 were documented already by LLNL in the JOATS Algorithm Manual so documentation for the remaining 7 was developed with the help of LLNL from documentation internal to the JCATS computer code. Evaluation of these algorithms (actually a subset of five or so key algorithms) within the context of a compendium of algorithms developed for the Close Combat Tactical Trainer (CCTT) developed by AMSAA revealed that several key algorithms (particularly target acquisition) should be upgraded, if possible. This research also revealed a document that could be used to provide the theoretical basis of most of the AMSAA algorithms, particularly those for attrition. Such a document was never available to LLNL. Although some key algorithms should be upgraded (mainly because of modeling and simulation developments of the last five years or so), all JCATS algorithms (including its target-acquisition algorithm) were at one time more than adequate for analysis purposes. Moreover, overall the algorithms reviewed are deemed to be adequate (particularly in comparison with Janus Army) for playing close combat with non-lethal weapons in urban terrain for purposes of analysis. Further work (particularly along the lines of the issues raised by this work) is necessary, however, to document these modeling issues.",  |aAlso available online,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |aaq/aq cc:9116 11/02/01.,,,,,4 |aAlgorithms evaluation.; 0|aTarget acquisition.; 0|aNonlethal weapons.; 0|aComputer programs.,,,,"1 |aNeta, Beny.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of Mathematics.,,,01|aNPS-MA-01-001.,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2001/NPS-MA-01-001.pdf|z(2.28 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA395759,,,"  |a*TARGET ACQUISITION, *NONLETHAL WEAPONS, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, ALGORITHMS, SIMULATION, VERIFICATION, TRAINING DEVICES, CLOSE SUPPORT, COMBAT SUPPORT, ATTRITION, TERRAIN, STANDARDS, CONFLICT, MANUAL OPERATION, URBAN AREAS.",,,,

In addition, the government's policymaking process has yet to achieve the degree of predictability, timeliness, and transparency that the firms need if they are expected to operate effectively in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace. The authors conclude with six recommendations that the U.S. Department of Commerce should adopt to best fulfill its responsibilities for promoting the U.S. commercial remote sensing industry and for encouraging the competitiveness of new private imaging satellite firms.""--Rand abstracts.",  |aAlso Available in microform and online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adln/dk oclc. 11/30/01.,,,,, 0|aArtificial satellites in remote sensing|zUnited States.; 0|aRisk assessment|zUnited States.; 0|aSpace industrialization|zUnited States.; 0|aSpace industrialization|zUnited States|xMarketing.,,,,"1 |aO'Connell, Kevin M.,|d1959-",2 |aRand Corporation.|bNational Security Research Division.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1469/;41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA399253,  |a20011129|lStacks;  |a20011129|lStacks,,"  |a*REMOTE DETECTORS, *ARTIFICIAL SATELLITES, *SATELLITE IMAGERY, INDUSTRIES, POLICIES, COMPETITION, OBSERVATION, AIRBORNE, IMAGES, TELEMETERING DATA, EARTH(PLANET).",  |aE0|bAD#,,,

They can be used to accurately model the propagation of small-amplitude acoustic pulses in the ocean for a bistatic scattering problem. Three different bistatic scattering problems are considered: (1) no motion, (2) only the discrete point scatterer is in motion, and (3) all three platforms (the transmitter, discrete point scatterer, and receiver) are in motion.

Both vouchers and charters promote educational choice, market accountability, and schools that are autonomously operated by non-government organizations. This book seeks to identify and articulate the full range of empirical questions that must be answered to fully assess the wisdom of policies that promote either of these alternatives. Eschewing the polemics that characterize both sides of the debate on school choice, the authors provide a comprehensive assessment of what is known about the effects of vouchers and charters in terms of five important outcomes: academic achievement, family choice, equitable access, racial/ethnic integration, and civic socialization.

It reviews current evaluation procedures, provides a framework for future evaluations, introduces evaluation approaches, and annotates resources for further research on each topic covered.

Its leaders have created a government based on popular sovereignty rather than Chinese nationalism; adopted pragmatic and creative approaches to expanding its international presence; and sought to make itself safe from attack or coercion by Mainland China through acquiring modern weapons, building a more efficient military, and developing closer military and political ties with the United States. China, in turn, has adopted a complex strategy of pressures and enticements to arrest Taiwan's moves toward greater independence. The United States and Japan also wield substantial influence over Taiwan's foreign and defense policies, but U.S. influence is clearly the dominant influence on Taiwan's decisions about theater ballistic missile defenses--providing information and advice that will strongly shape the course of Taiwan's planning, procurement, and deployment.

For example, in DC ZEDS a Ship Service Inverter Module (SSIM) converts DC power into AC power for use within a zone. For reasons of redundancy and logistics, multiple paralleled inverter submodules are used to implement the SSIM. The current effort supports ongoing SSIM hardware development by the SatCon Corporation. This report documents the modeling and control analysis of a set of parallel-connected PWM inverters. Although initially focusing on a static three-phase R-L load, the analysis is extended to three-phase symmetrical induction machine loads and three-phase round-rotor permanent-magnet synchronous machine loads. In each case, an algorithm for designing the local inner current control is developed by employing reference frame theory, replacing the paralleled inverters by an equivalent unit, and executing a nonlinear pole-placement strategy. Upon reviewing the equations necessary for AC machine vector control, the report concludes by documenting the analysis and design of a simple speed control loop for this aformentioned machine loads.",  |aAlso Available in microform and online.,,,  |aSystem Requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/dk cc:9116 2/26/02,,,,, 0|aElectric power production.; 0|aElectric power distribution.,,,,"1 |aAshton, Robert W.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of.

The first of those studies developed an operational methodology for quantifying these benefits. Drawing on that methodology, significant economic benefits were found associated with naval operations in the Arabian Gulf The second study expanded the QDR97 effort in several important directions. First, event analysis was introduced to link naval activity with price movements in key commodity, exchange, and share markets. Second, several additional cases, one not directly involving oil, were developed to assess the generality of our findings. The findings of the first study were confirmed with naval forward presence/crisis response shown to produce extensive economic benefits for the US economy in each of the cases examined. The current study places the two previous ones in a larger context Here the linkages between naval forward presence/crisis response and oil prices are examined in the context of changes in the global economy and the various dimensions of globalization. An operational procedure is developed to measure the various facets of globalization and track their movements over time. The magnitude of oil price shocks' effect on domestic economies is shown to depend critically on the global environment in which they occur. In all, the three studies paint a similar picture-that of naval forward presence playing an increasingly important role in stabilizing the economies of the advanced industrial nations. Other parts of the world benefit also, although trends in globalization suggest the economic gains that accrue from naval forward presence are of a lower magnitude.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/dk cc:9116 3/11/02,,,,, 0|aNational security.; 0|aEconometrics.,,,,"1 |aSchrady, David A.","1 |aPorch, Douglas.;2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDept. of.

In this application the spiral bevel gears are required to transmit very high torque at high rotational speed. Available experimental data on the operational characteristics for thermal and structural behavior is relatively small in comparison to that found for parallel axis gears. An ongoing test program has been in place at NASA Glenn Research Center over the last ten years to investigate their operational behavior at operating conditions found in aerospace applications. This paper will summarize the results of the tests conducted on face-milled spiral bevel gears. The data from the pinion member (temperature and stress) were taken at conditions from slow-roll to 14400 rpm and up to 537 kW (720 hp). The results have shown that operating temperature is affected by the location of the lubricating jet with respect to the point it is injected and the operating conditions that are imposed. Also the stress measured from slow-roll to very high rotational speed, at various torque levels, indicated little dynamic affect over the rotational speeds;  |a01 - APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE",  |a436648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  |uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA398899,,,,,,,

We obtained direct evidence that NMDA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in interneurons are blocked by NMDA antagonists (MK-801), the first direct evidence for their hypothesized neurotoxic mechanism. Physostigmine and pilocarpine suppressed GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents; MK-801 was additive to them. In vivo, MK-801 is more neurotoxic in older than younger rats: in PCC/RSC slices, NMDA-mediated EPSCs were more rapidly suppressed by MK-801 in adults, suggesting a mechanism for age differences. Ethanol had more complex effects, and younger rats were more sensitive. In vivo, MK-801 alone produced FJ-B-positive neurodegeneration in the PCC/RSC, whereas, when used alone, AChEIs pyridostigmine and physostigmine did not. These findings are relevant to prevention of nerve agent exposures: NMDA antagonist drugs (e.g. for pain, neuroprotection, or recreation (e.g., ethanol)) could be co-administered with AChEIs (e.g., for soman prophylaxis). To avoid unexpected synergistic neurotoxicity in humans, the potential for serious neurotoxic interactions must be carefully explored in animals.;  |a01 - APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE",  |a347350,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  |uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA399055,,,,,,,

The investigation covers a diverse range of composite electrolyte compositions and reveals that the incorporation of a ceramic component in a polymer matrix leads to enhanced conductivity. The conductivity enhancement depends upon the weight fraction of the ceramic phase, annealing parameters, nature of polymer-ceramic system, and temperature. The roles of ceramic additives are to depress the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) melting temperature and retard kinetics of its crystallization. A resistivity relaxation or conductivity enhancement below the melting temperature of PEO occurs, which appears to be a characteristic of these electrolytes and related to an interaction of dipoles associated with polymer chain and ceramic particles.;  |a01 - APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE",  |a105400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  |uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA399050,,,,,,,

Soldiers from four Infantry courses participated, representing the chain of command within an Infantry platoon, from platoon leader to rifleman. Soldiers were first trained on codes that uniquely identified individuals and units on the map. Then soldiers learned how to use map functions such as pan, zoom, determine range, and find individuals and units. Lessons that contained a large volume of information before soldiers could apply that information and commit it to memory resulted in low scores on both the code and map exercises. Breaking: up the content into smaller chunks of information tended to be more effective. Although soldiers who learned the map on their own via an exploratory condition had the lowest map performance, exploratory learning may have potential as these soldiers spent relatively little time 'exploring'. The results demonstrate the importance of adapting to individual differences in the learning rate of soldiers.

He inherited a bitterly-divided nation in the midst of an outbreak of spontaneous rural fighting known as La Violencia. This thesis concerns the efforts of the Rojas government to bring an end to La Violencia through both peaceful and military means. The major themes of the paper are the causes of social violence, government counterinsurgency policy, Colombian politics of the 194Os and l95Os, and U.S. military aid during the Cold War. This thesis pays particular attention to the role of the Colombian armed forces and national police. Rojas' unique position as an (initially) popular dictator and his varied attempts to retain power frequently involved military uses and abuses. The role of the United States in Rojas' government will also receive considerable attention since U.S. arms and diplomats vied for influence in Colombia's government. Finally the paper attempts to draw conclusions about the unfolding of Colombian political history and more general lessons on social violence and political insurgency.;  |a01 - APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE",  |a012200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,  |uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA399339,,,,,,,

This study conducted a field test of the performance two magnetic and one electronic descalers to determine if the devices would reduce or prevent the formation of mineral scale under field condition. The devices tested did not prevent mineral scale formation under the conditions of this study.

It also emerged that the fat content of the ration has had a tendency to rise because 0 the increasing number of fat-containing spreads in the ration. Because this trend can be pinpointed to one group of foods, it could be corrected by decreasing the number of occurrences or package weight of these items.

First, we must retain the budgetary practice of recognizing the full cost of a decision to acquire an asset--no matter how long its expected useful life-when that decision is made. The up-front, full-cost basis of accounting for capital acquisition at the governmentwide level is conceptually sound, consistent with common practice and economic efficiency, and necessary for budget discipline. Second, we can improve both the budget account structure and the budget process by attributing all the costs of acquiring and holding capital to the particular programs that use the assets. Doing so would facilitate the management of capital resources and support the objectives of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA).

The objectives of these models were to minimize the aggregate mean supply response time (MSRT) or to maximize the aggregate gross effectiveness (G-E) for the spare and repair parts of a new weapon system. The constraint in each model was the budget available to procure the parts. This report presents the evaluation of the proposed models using data from seven actual systems previously provisioned by SPCC and five actual systems previously provisioned by ASO. The Navy's criterion for accepting a new model was that it had to provide at least a 5% improvement over the existing models, the Variable Threshold (VT) model of SPCC and the D52 model of ASO, using aggregate mean supply response time and aggregate gross effectiveness as the performance measures. The evaluations showed that the MSRT model easily satisfied this criterion for ten of the systems and gave the same results as the existing models for the other two. The G-E model did not perform as well but did perform better than the current models for the same ten systems and gave the same results as the existing models for the other two systems. As a consequence of these evaluations, the Navy accepted the MSRT model in December of 1984.

A second aspect of manpower supply that is unique to the reserves is that serving in the reserves is in many respects similar to a part-time job. These two characteristics of reserve manpower supply create numerous recruiting problems not faced by the regular branches of the service. The purpose of this report is to outline a methodology for estimating manpower supply to the reserves. The techniques rely upon economic theories of part-time and second job holding to identify factors affecting the potential labor supply at the local labor market level. The paper identifies alternative empirical models appropriate to specify reserve supply functions, and available data sources.

This new method is the Soviet theory of reflexive control, which, briefly stated, can be defined as, 'a means of conveying to a partner or an opponent specially prepared information to incline him to voluntarily make the predetermined decision.' Several authoritative studies have been published which describe in depth and in detail the scientific and mathematical components of reflexive control, and its various military and technical applications. However, less attention has been devoted to an examination of the underlying historical and psychocultural factors which may have contributed to the development of this particular orientation toward decision making. The present research effort represents an attempt to narrow this gap in our understanding of the evolution and significance of the theory of reflexive control, and to develop a psychohistorical framework within which the theory may come to be better understood by Western analysts of Soviet affairs.

The methodology enables quick turn around and efficient exploration of sensitivities of measures of Blue combat success to realistically imperfect Blue intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities: limited and imperfect sensor surveillance and reconnaissance, particularly battle damage assessment (BDA), and finite, hence saturable, communications and weapons delivery capability. The model explicitly represents aircraft sorties, fires, sensor/shooter latencies, target losses, imperfect target type classification, imperfect weapon assignment, and BDA; various levels of the above imperfections can be applied, facilitating tradeoff studies, The model is deterministic/ expected value in nature, although it analytically represents time-dependent stochastic features such as system saturability. Model experimentation suggests the following results. Decreasing shooter latency can result in greater attrition than correspondingly increasing the probabilities of correct BDA or weapon assignment, although at the expense of a greater number of weapons fired per target killed. Erroneous BDA returns dead targets to the shooter targeting list. These dead targets not only result in wasted weapon expenditure but also take sensor/shooter resources away from legitimate live targets. Increasing the probability of correct BDA can result in a greater number of targets killed during a time period than increasing the probability of correct weapon assignment. .",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |apa/     Original. 02/11/03,,,,, 0|aElectronic countermeasures.; 0|aCommand and control systems|zUnited States.,,,,"1 |aJacobs, Patricia A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bMOVES Institute.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2002/NPS-OR-02-005.pdf|z(1.20 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA405471,,,"  |a*COMMAND CONTROL COMMUNICATIONS, *STOCHASTIC PROCESSES, *INFORMATION PROCESSING, *INFORMATION WARFARE, QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS, INTELLIGENCE, DETECTORS, AIRCRAFT, TIME DEPENDENCE, DAMAGE ASSESSMENT, ATTRITION, EFFICIENCY, COSTS, MISSIONS, ALLOCATIONS, TRADE OFF ANALYSIS, BATTLES, BLUE(COLOR), TARGET CLASSIFICATION, SURVEILLANCE, RECONNAISSANCE, STRIKE WARFARE, WEAPON DELIVERY",  |aX0|bAD#,,,

One aspect is the geometrical relationship between components; the other aspect includes the quantitative geometrical variables of length, area, volume, shape, and location. About one-half of the paper is devoted to background information concerning interaction between arrangements and various ship characteristics. Topics discussed include items such as seakeeping, sensor location, topside design, weapon location, habitability, and NBC protection. Several different models can be developed to assess arrangements. One approach is to introduce the quantitative aspect of arrangements (length, volume, etc.) into the overall ship design process. The relationship aspect of arrangements is an input made by the designer. Once the design of a warship has converged and has been optimized, the ship can be subjected to combat simulation. During the combat simulation, the relationship aspect can be assessed. Two optimized warships differing in relationship of components fight the same battle. Based on performance in the combat simulation, one ship will be superior. An approach based on subsystems and the interaction between subsystems has been formulated. The formulation is a useful tool for identification of interactions; however, the subsystem method seems less direct than the two step process of overall ship design and combat simulation.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |ack/ 6/10/09.,,,,, 0|aShipbuilding|xDesign and construction|xMathematical models.; 0|aNaval architecture|xMathematical models.; 0|aWarships|xTesting.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA083843,  |lgen|nL|aV767|b.F95|s1|tnorm|y00001|u00001|i32768000424733,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

At present, we refer to the embodiment of software-based deception as intelligent software decoys, although this name may change in the next phase of our research. The key idea that we are pursuing is that software-based deception can be used to harden software assets against attack. An important novel aspect of our research is that we introduce the concept of conducting counterintelligence and intelligently employing countermeasures in cyberspace via software-based deception. The owners of computing assets may have to deploy intelligent software decoys with such capabilities in order to counter attacks conducted by technology-savvy terrorists and criminals, in addition to information warriors from rogue or enemy nation-states; conventional countermeasures will likely be ineffective against the sophisticated arsenal of cyber weapons at the disposal of such attackers, and any countermeasure will be difficult to deploy without reliable counterintelligence, particularly if the users of countermeasures intend to avoid becoming cyber war criminals. In this report, we summarize our research and its relevance to Homeland security, and briefly discuss our plans for furthering our work under Phase II of the Naval Postgraduate School's Homeland Security Research & Technology Program.

NAVSUP will maintain control and responsibility of the application software, but all server and infrastructure hardware as well as system software support (operating system, monitoring software, utilities, and infrastructure software), is the responsibility of the service provider. The SOW details hosting requirements at three levels to allow program managers to select the levels and the corresponding services that best meet their needs. A service level agreement (SLA) is an agreement between a provider of services and a customer that defines a level of performance. This agreement defines in measurable terms the service to be performed, the level of service that is acceptable, and the means to determine if the service is being provided at the agreed upon levels. SLAs define the quality of service, and how it is measured. There are fourteen SLAs defined that support the SOW. This paper provides a starting point for negotiating host services. The intent of this paper is to give the program managers a document that listed hosting services that will provide a high level of support for their application.

Using a quasi-price measure for comparison and examining social welfare as a basis for assessing market-design alternatives, we provide novel insight into the balance required between technologically enabled efficiency and economically principled effectiveness of markets. Additionally, this experiment addresses labor market economics in an analytically difficult, public-sector context, yet the market designs and associated technologies are quite general, so the experiment also provides insight into private-sector markets as well.

Unfortunately, with the strong presumption that knowledge is distinct from data and information, knowledge-flow mechanics in the warfare context are not well understood; even the term knowledge is used in conflicting ways (e.g., to describe information flows) by NCW experts, operational personnel and developers of military doctrine. Mapping key concepts from technologically enabled business models in which NCW is based in large part to the military, we substitute the term understanding flow when discussing the mechanics of how knowledge flows in the NCW context. In one respect, this mapping and terminological substitution enable us to move forward and model knowledge-flow mechanics in a manner that is consistent with the operational Navy's lexicon; in another respect, however, it is clear that Navy lexicon does not yet include the term understanding flow. Hence, naval conceptualization of NCW may be missing a vital element. Informed by recent advances in knowledge-flow theory, the research described in this technical report develops a four-dimensional model of understanding-flow mechanics. This multidimensional model enables a novel capability to recognize a variety of understanding-flow patterns found in the military enterprise, to distinguish such patterns from their counterparts pertaining to information and data, and to enhance the speed and efficiency of NCW understanding flows. Just as understanding the mechanics of electrical flow is critical to developing useful electronic devices, understanding the mechanics of understanding flow is critical to conceiving useful NCW systems.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aKnowledge management.; 0|aInformation resources management.; 0|aExpert systems (Computer science),,,,,"2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of Naval Research.;1 |aUnited States.|bNavy.|bFleet, 3rd.",,,,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA406729;41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2002/NPS-GSBPP-02-001.pdf|z(154 KB),,,"  |a*INFORMATION TRANSFER, *KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, NAVAL OPERATIONS, KNOWLEDGE BASED SYSTEMS, NETWORK FLOWS.",  |aX0|bAD#,,,

But a dearth of theory and methods to predict process performance is available to the enterprise manager. With the proposition that enterprise process design represents an engineering problem as much as a managerial one, we focus on the process configuration and measurement to overcome design limitations that currently confront the enterprise manager. Building on seminal work for process description and comparison, and employing Graph Theory and Measurement Theory, we integrate this work and demonstrate useful analytical properties associated with the kinds of measures proposed (e.g., ratio scales). This represents a new result, which extends the prior research on enterprise process design and makes a contribution to our understanding in management science. Further, with parallels to the predictive capability enjoyed by engineers who design physical artifacts, we indicate how enterprise process configuration measures can be used to hypothesize relations with respect to enterprise performance. And we suggest how enterprise managers may design processes in a deductive manner-working backward from performance requirements to determine configuration parameters required for designs to meet performance goals.

Three test signals are used: two frequency chirped signals and a Barker coded BPSK signal. The most effective processing sequence for the chirp signals is median filtering, followed by FFT processing, which in turn, is followed by median filtering of the FFT transform coefficients.

Viewing respective procurement and order fulfillment processes of buyer and seller as an integrated whole along the supply chain, we identify opportunities for virtual supply chain re-intermediation through multi- agent systems. Using a proof-concept agent federation, called the Intelligent Mall, we examine the feasibility and performance implications of this approach for a software supply chain. A long-lived, autonomous agent federation is observed performing delegated supply chain tasks as prescribed and in an intelligent, context-sensitive and policy-conforming manner. The kind of agent- integrated supply chain investigated through this work appears to be inherently scalable yet customizable to the level of a specific individual in the organization. This approach to supply chain re-intermediation also appears to generalize well to a wide variety of corporations, universities and other enterprise forms, and the intelligent mall examined in this report appears to offer good potential for improved process performance. This report summarizes exploratory results from experience with the Intelligent Mall and outlines a number of lessons learned and guidelines for implementing multi-agent systems.

The report argues that in such new conditions we need to rethink how we conceive the structural dimensions of organizational form and base them on a process model of inter-organizational relationships. This report examines relationship complexity as a structural topology that underlies organizational form It identifies three structural dimensions of relationship complexity reach, range, and reciprocity and combines them in a model that allows dynamic reconfigurability. The model is based on the primacy of perspective of practicing managers and we have termed it the Rolodex Model as it has overtones of an organizational version of a manager's card file of contacts. Using the concepts of energy and phase space from physics to enrich the Rolodex Model, the report shows how it can be used to explain existing archetypes of organizational forms, to identity new organizational forms, and to provide insights for organizational design The report then argues that further elaboration of energy concepts and relationship complexity may be necessary before we can fully respond to, and anticipate, the complex, dynamic, hypercompetitive organizational environment of today , much less that likely to exist tomorrow.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aOrganizational change.; 0|aOrganizational behavior.; 0|aOrganizational sociology.,,,,"1 |aEl Sawy, Omar A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of Naval Research.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA407951;41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2002/NPS-GSBPP-02-004.pdf|z(522 KB),,,"  |a*ORGANIZATIONS, *PERFORMANCE(ENGINEERING), *PHYSICAL PROPERTIES, *STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES, *MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, COMMERCE, ENVIRONMENTS, ENERGY, TOPOLOGY, PHYSICS.",  |aX0|bAD#,,,

The Center for INFOSEC Studies and Research (CISR) in Monterey, California, proposes a three-pronged approach to strengthen the national information infrastructure and reinvigorate the national capability to produce trustworthy computing systems. First, we describe our Trusted Computing Exemplar project as a worked example of how trusted computing systems and components can be constructed. Second, we define a national research initiative to advance the theoretical foundations for trusted computing and to produce a set of automated tools to support the development of high assurance systems; and third, we define an education at initiative based on nascent information Assurance education programs and the Trusted Computing Exemplar to provide a framework for Trusted Computer Development education.

This effort included the field-testing of an atmospheric dispersion prediction model, an instrumented UAV for collecting meteorological data, and the means for linking the UAV data to real-time dispersion prediction. The primary modeling effort focused on an adaptation of the 'Wind On Constant Streamline Surfaces' (WOCSS) model developed to run on a small computer with input from an external mesoscale model (MM5). The combined models were run for approximately one month for the region surrounding Camp Roberts, CA. In situ meteorological data were collected at the Camp Roberts airfield from 2 October to 5 November 2002 to validate the model predictions. The model results showed promise in capturing the diurnal evolution of near-surface temperatures that drive the local circulations in the warm season. Linking WOCSS with the atmospheric mesoscale model forecasts showed no significant improvement in wind forecasts when compared to the mesoscale model wind forecasts alone. Linking WOCSS to the trajectory visualization code revealed that vertical wind component estimates needed to be improved. The linked model/UAV demonstration of 7-9 October 2002 tested the synthesis of UAV measurements and dispersion model predictions. Although a UAV mishap occurred soon after the demonstration began, the instrumented UAV performance during this early period and in preliminary flight tests indicate that the hardware/software architecture for UAV data collection and its linkage with real-time dispersion prediction will be successful. Overall, the demonstration proved the feasibility of linking a coarse grid mesoscale model to a fine-scale diagnostic wind model for producing fine resolution forward and backward trajectories.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aChemical weapons.; 0|aBiological weapons.; 0|aDrone aircraft.; 0|aWeapons of mass destruction.,,,,"1 |aDavidson, Kenneth L.;1 |aKaminer, Isaac.;1 |aMiller, Douglas.;1 |aDobrokhdov, Vladimir.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA412243;41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2003/NPS-MR-03-001.pdf|z(781 KB),,,"  |a*DISPERSING, *PREDICTIONS, *BIOLOGICAL WARFARE, *CHEMICAL WARFARE, *DECISION AIDS, *ATMOSPHERE MODELS, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, FLIGHT TESTING, BIOLOGICAL AGENTS, REAL TIME, WIND, COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE, THESES, ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES, METEOROLOGICAL DATA, WEATHER FORECASTING, AERONAUTICS, INTEGRATION, METEOROLOGY, DATA ACQUISITION, DIURNAL VARIATIONS",  |aX0|bAD#,,,

As important as this task is it has not significantly changed since World War I. Sea Force is an attempt to show that sea basing, as discussed by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) in Sea Power 21, can be accomplished by the year 2020 with reasonable advances in technology. The concept of sea basing implies a number of capabilities that are not inherent in current expeditionary forces, among these are Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM), indefinite sustainment, selective offload, reconstitution of forces ashore, long range Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS), and an increased capability in command and control. The Marine Corps has also established the requirement of a 3.0 Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) lift capability that is not currently met by the existing force structure. The Total Ship Systems Engineering Program undertook the task of designing a system of ships that could be brought together to enable the sea basing of one MEB for an indefinite period of time. The Sea Force design completely supports all of the operational requirements of STOM in addition to providing a path for re-supply and a method for reconstitution of forces ashore. Sea Force also is designed to be reconfigurable from a warship to a supply ship during a shipyard availability period with minimal effort through the use of modularity. The first design analysis was based on combining the capabilities of the MPF, LMSR, and LHA ships into a single hull one-ship-does-all concept. The second design analysis was based on an MPF/LMSR variant with a separate LHA design. The third design analysis, the LHA/MPF with LMSR design, combines two ships on similar hull forms but with different structural requirements, layouts, and missions.

This phenomenon continues despite the fact that they recognize some of the benefits of computational assistance, that they have had experience using computer systems, and that they have access to such a network. Their reluctance usually stems from the feeling that the very machines and systems is not justified by the occasional or intermittent nature of their computational problems. In learning to use a new system, a large part of the familiarization effort is spent in trying to learn to use a new text editing program. If such a utility program were standardized and made available on all of the machines on the network, a large obstacle to the efficient use of such systems might be removed. The design of such a system, a Standard Line EDitor called SLED is proposed here.

How can we make our designs not only more precise, but make these systems more accurately and cost effectively achieve their goals? We have begun to rely upon computer aided design techniques. The use of these techniques often commences not with the statement of the system goals, but rather with the specification of an architecture and a logic technology. In view of the high costs of computer development, we should be quite confident that our architecture/technology combination is capable of meeting the system requirements before we proceed to more detailed design phases. The entire system design process must be integrated, and include performance prediction and verification techniques. This design process should be reflected in a single description language. A methodology for accomplishing this goal capable of employing many existing design practices is discussed here.

This thesis has two main purposes. Critical parts concerning thermal control in the current design are identified and the thermal design for NPSAT1 is improved. Furthermore this developed design is analyzed for being appropriate and temperature-time predictions are developed.  Both design objectives are accomplished with the help of EDS I-DEAS with Maya's TMG. After defining all constraints and requirements, a thermal FE model is developed, documented, and verified. Simulations with this model are used to track insufficiencies concerning the thermal design. With their help, different design approaches are analyzed to obtain sensitivity information. Proposals for design changes are made. Four worst-case scenarios are defined and the developed design is evaluated with their help.

We have found that it is possible to construct a mandatory ring execution policy whose primary function is to restrict subjects from executing certain file system objects, and that this may result in a more coherent and manageable policy than what can be expected from various discretionary (e.g., policy-bypass or privilege-grouping) mechanisms.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |apa/    Original.  06/06/03,,,,, 0|aComputer security.,,,,"1 |aLevin, Timothy E.;1 |aIrvine, Cynthia E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bCenter for Information Systems Security Studies and Research.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2003/NPS-CS-03-003.pdf|z(448 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA412737,,,"  |a*COMPUTER ACCESS CONTROL, FILES(RECORDS), SOFTWARE ENGINEERING, POLICIES, DATA PROCESSING SECURITY, OPERATING SYSTEMS(COMPUTERS), COMPUTER APPLICATIONS",  |aX0|bAD#,,,

But enterprises do not all operate in the same environmental context and current theory is relatively silent on contextual implications of knowledge flow. The research described in this technical report builds upon current theory to explicitly address the contextual implications of knowledge flow in terms of organization and process design. Using a recently developed, multidimensional model to characterize and delineate a variety of enterprise knowledge flows, we integrate key aspects of Coordination Theory and extend this model to address context. The use, utility and implications of this extended model are described through application to an extreme case in which knowledge flows are embedded within a hazardous, time-critical context with mortal consequences: a military ""friendly fire"" incident in Northern Iraq. The extreme nature of this application case provides revelatory insight into the contextual importance of knowledge-flow dynamics, and by using such an extreme case for application, we enhance the generalizability of our model to less extreme environments that are more commonly associated with non-military enterprises (e.g., corporations, governmental agencies)",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |apa/     Original.  10/01/03,,,,, 0|aKnowledge management.; 0|aInformation technology.,,,,"1 |aNissen, Mark E.;1 |aJansen, Erik.;1 |aJones, Carl R.;1 |aThomas, Gail Fann.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of Naval Research.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2003/NPS-GSBPP-03-002.pdf|z(469 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA417483,,,"  |a*IDENTIFICATION SYSTEMS, *FRIENDLY FIRE, *KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, ENVIRONMENTS, ORGANIZATIONS, THEORY, PATTERN RECOGNITION, FLOW, DYNAMIC TESTS",  |aX0|bAD#,,,

At the core of this debate stands the question which of the two post-event policies to adopt: mass vaccination-where maximum vaccination capacity is utilized to uniformly inoculate the entire population, or trace (also called ring or targeted) vaccination-where mass vaccination capabilities are traded off with tracing capabilities to selectively inoculate only contacts (or suspected contacts) of infective individuals. We present a dynamic epidemic-intervention model that expands previous models by capturing some additional key features of the situation and by generalizing some assumptions regarding the probability distributions of inter-temporal parameters. The model comprises a set of difference equations. The model is implemented to analyze alternative response policies.

As a rule, battle-management is executed at the system level rather than the desired system-of-systems level. Typically, C4 systems are non-real-time systems. Traditionally, weapon systems are real-time systems. If we are to match the performance of weapon systems and avoid the negative impact of forcing synchronization of battle manager software with weapon systems for messaging, then we must develop the battle manager as real-time software. We advocate the development of battle-management software as a real-time set of system functionality that addresses warfighter usage. To achieve the level of desired predictable battle-management behavior, we maintain that it is essential to develop a formal representation that captures the desired battle manager system behavior and test the formal representation against the expected battle-management properties. Furthermore, we assert that it is critical to develop the battle manager as a real-time software-intensive system to ensure the schedulability of battlemanagement tasks and provide for concurrent execution of such tasks where applicable.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |apa/     Original.  10/01/03,,,,, 0|aBattles.; 0|aMilitary art and science.; 0|aCombat.; 0|aSystems software.,,,,"1 |aMichael, James Bret",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bMissile Defense Agency.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2003/NPS-CS-03-006.pdf|z(252 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA417574,,,"  |a*COMPUTER PROGRAMS, *BATTLE MANAGEMENT, PREDICTIONS, REAL TIME, WEAPON SYSTEMS, PLATFORMS, COMMAND AND CONTROL SYSTEMS, MILITARY PLANNING",  |aX0|bAD#,,,

Since this time all new classes of combatants have been required to conduct shock trial tests on the lead ship of the class in order to test the survivability of mission essential equipment in a severe shock environment. While these tests are extremely important in determining the vulnerabilities of a surface ship, they require an extensive amount of preparation, manhours, and money. Furthermore, these tests present an obvious danger to the crew on board, the ship itself, and any marine life in the vicinity. Creating a virtual shock environment by use of a computer to model the ship structure and the surrounding fluid presents a valuable design tool and an attractive alternative to these tests. The research summarized in this report investigated the accuracy of shock simulation using the shock trials conducted on USS WINSTON S. CHURCHILL (DDG 81) in 2001. All three explosions DDG 81 was subjected to are simulated and the resulting predictions compared with actual shock trial data.

However, there is evidence that exterior (outside of the manpower process) influences have affected decisions relative to the officer manpower requirements. By changing requirements to match inventory the signal sent throughout the MPT system to program, recruit, train, educated and distribute personnel has now had its foundation changed to reflect not the future but the present state. With this as a systematic procedure, the process of officer manpower requirements is no longer dynamic, but rather static, and tied directly to the present and externally influenced personnel inventory.   There currently exists no formalized and approved process for the development of officer specific manpower requirements. Pieces of the process are evident in the formulation of pay grade specific data and definitions. However, there is no concrete evidence that a system exists on which to base the officer manpower requirement.   Formulate and formalize a process for the definition of officer at-sea manpower requirements. This process should be flexible and adaptable to the changing nature of at-sea manpower. This process should be able to meet the demand for review of existing workload on board units at sea but adaptable to describe the duties, responsibilities and workload associated with new classes and ship designs.

This report comprises the first phase of the realization of such a system: the comprehensive design of a multilevel secure file storage system. This is the focus of an ongoing research project, which is currently in the early implementation phases. The design is based upon security kernel technology as applied to modern multiple microcomputer arrays. This design is intended to interface with other (distributed) processing elements, perhaps forming the central hub of a data secure network of computers. The design would provide archival shared storage while insuring that each interfacing processor accessed only that information appropriate. The design phase of the project is presented in a series of three research reports (Masters Degree theses). These reports, reprinted in their entirety here are: (1) O'Connell and Richardson's definition of a secure multi-microprocessor family of operating systems; (2) Coleman's detailed security kernel design for a member of this family; and (3) Parks' hierarchical file system designed to run under the control of Coleman's security kernel.

A survey questionnaire was sent to companies identified as refusing DOD business as well as a random sample of companies selected from various industries. An analysis of the responses indicates that approximately 20% of the surveyed firms refuse DOD business due to such reasons as burdensome paperwork, Government bidding methods, more attractive commercial ventures and Government attitudes. The study analyzes examples of each of these reasons as well as twenty-two additional problem areas. Implications of small versus large business and prime contractor versus subcontractor views are examined.

This has led to confusion within the acquisition workforce over the major policy thrusts, terminology, and unobvious implications of the changes. The new acquisition framework has added complexity, with more phases and delineations of activity -- and both the number and level of decision reviews have been increased. Decision reviews are typically used as top management level control gates, and are also a feature of centralized control within a bureaucracy. Although the current stated policy is to foster an environment supporting flexibility and innovation, the new framework will cause Program Managers to devote more time and other resources managing the decision bureaucracy. Moreover, the implicit aspects of the still new model have not been fully realized, and may result in policy that actually lengthens programs and delivers yesterday's technology tomorrow -- counter to goals of rapid transformation.

To identify critical system components (e.g., transmission lines, generators, transformers), we devise bilevel optimization models that identify maximally disruptive attack plans for terrorists, who are assumed to have limited offensive resources. A new model captures the dynamics of system operation as a network is repaired after an attack, and we adapt an earlier heuristic for that model's solution. We also develop a new, mixed-integer programming model (MIP) for the problem; a model that can be solved exactly using standard optimization software, at least in theory. Preliminary testing shows that optimal solutions are readily achieved for certain standard test problems, although not for the largest ones, which the heuristic seems to handle well. However, optimal solutions do provide a benchmark to measure the accuracy of the heuristic: The heuristic typically achieves optimality gaps of less than 10%, but occasionally the gap reaches 25%. Research will continue to refine the heuristic algorithm, the MIP formulation, and the algorithms to solve it. We also demonstrate progress made towards a graphical user interface that allows performing our interdiction analysis in a friendly environment.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |apa/      Original.  03/18/04,,,,, 0|aElectric power systems|xProtection.; 0|aComputer networks|xSecurity measures.; 0|aTerrorism|zUnited States|xPrevention.,,,  |aHomeland security|zUnited States.,"1 |aWood, R.

Following the terminology of (Karp and Held 1967), a discrete optimization problem is formalized as a discrete decision problem and the class of dynamic programs is formalized as a sequential decision process. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the representation in two different senses of a discrete decision problem by a sequential decision process are established. In the first sense (a strong representation) the set of all optimal solutions to the discrete optimization problem is obtainable from the solution of the functional equations of dynamic programming. In the second sense (a weak representation) a nonempty subset of optimal solutions is obtainable from the solution of the functional equations of dynamic programming. It is shown that the well known principle of optimality corresponds to a strong representation. A more general version of the principle of optimality is given which corresponds to a weak representation of a discrete decision problem by a sequential decision process. We also show that the class of strongly representable discrete decision problems is equivalent to the class of sequential decision processes which have cost functions satisfying a strict monotonicity condition. Also a new derivation is given of the result that the class of weakly representable discrete decision problems is equivalent to the class of sequential decision processes which have a cost function satisfying a monotonicity condition.

The pilot in nine firing passes (one target was not fired on, and the pilot missed one intended target) fired a total of 565 rounds, of which 140 impacted the targets. Of the projectiles impacting on targets, 17 achieved perforations of the armored envelope. Significant results include: one tank immobilized and silenced; one tank silenced, mobility seriously degraded; three tanks immobilized only; two tanks immobilized, firepower seriously degraded; one tank light firepower damage; and two tanks suffered no damage.

The primary lesson is that the PPB system has always been in an evolutionary mode, with constant improvements along a generalized conceptual path. It was not created once and for all and operated as a fixed template. While it is an expensive system to operate in terms of people and time, no other system appears to solve the requirement for planning for and resourcing systems and personnel to meet the threat posed to U.

In many instances these loads fluctuate in time in an apparently random fashion. Certain loads vary rather slowly (called constant loads); other loads occur more nearly as impulses (shock loads). Suppose that the stress put on the structure by various loads acting simultaneously can be expressed as a linear combination of the load magnitudes. In this paper certain simple but somewhat realistic probabilistic load models are given and the resulting probabilistic model of the total stress on the structure caused by the loads is considered. The distribution of the first time until the stress on the structure exceeds a given level x, and the distribution of the maximum stress put on the structure during the time interval (0,t) are studied. Asymptotic properties are also given. It is shown that the asymptotic properties of the maximum stress are related to those of the maxima of a sequence of dependent random variables.

Survivability was identified as the most critical factor for evaluating the protection of the Sea Base and its transport assets. Threats to the Sea Base were reviewed, analyzed, and prioritized. System design and analysis focused on preliminary analyses of various sensors, search concepts, and weapons. These preliminary analyses identified capability gaps that were translated into functional concepts and proposed architectures for detailed modeling and analysis. These proposed architectures were identified as either Point or Distributed. In order to adequately determine the relative performance of the proposed architectures generated by the team, a thorough and systematic design of experiments was developed and applied in the Naval Simulation System and EXTEND.

In particular, the deployment of this class of processes will enable Red to take account in a natural way of the relative threats posed to his own survival in taking targeting actions.

Major strategic changes would be made in the second and fourth year of a Presidential term and minimal updating change made in the first and third years. Third, it fixed timing of the process so that planning and budgeting were clearly derivative processes driven by the Quadrennial Defense Review and the National Military Strategy. Fourth, it changed the cycle for Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) provision of the top level planning information to the military departments and services from annual to biennial. The result of these changes was to create a two-year decision cycle with a complete review in year one followed by limited incremental review in year two. This was meant to decrease turbulence and reduce unnecessary re-making of decisions. The desired outcome was that decisions would be made more quickly and provide the right defense products faster, while the ""off-year"" would help improve the focus on budget execution.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |apa/      07/13/04,,10|aUnited States.|bDept. of Defense|xManagement.,,, 0|aProgram budgeting|zUnited States.,,,,"1 |aJones, Lawrence R.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2004/NPS-GSBPP-04-002.pdf|z(870 KB),,,,  |aX0|bAD#,,,

Regression analysis was used to investigate which components of the GRE and APC scores (together with age and years since graduation) are important in predicting academic performance as measured by grade point averages (GPA's).

A key factor that must be considered is that the design environment currently evolving uses functionally high level VLSI-based building blocks to construct various network architectures. This paper begins by reviewing the uses of a taxonomy in a network context, and continues with a review of specifications for network requirements. A set of hardware interconnection primitives is defined next. A review of the Anderson and Jensen taxonomy (Ander75) is then presented, with a discussion of its completeness. The main thrust of this article is given in a section of attributes of a design oriented taxonomy. Finally, extensions are proposed for fault tolerant considerations and protocols. A computer network is defined to be a hetrogeneous collection of computers and the telecommunications subsystem linking them together. Here the properties of the various network architectures are of particular interest; the 'user' computers (or processors) are considered as sources and sinks of messages being transmitted over the network. No distinction as to the geographical scope of the network is made because it does not impact the taxonomy considerations addressed here.

Smoothness priors distributions on the model parameters are expressed either in terms of time domain stochastic difference equation or frequency domain constraints. A small number of (hyper)parameters specify very complex time series behavior. The critical computation is the likelihood of the Bayesian model.

The model also represents the effect of tracing and quarantining as control options. The model has been implemented in Java for a Web-based educational tool.

They set high standards and tailor their programs to the unique culture of the school and the needs of the students, whether the needs are to help students get into college, maintain a winning drill team, or create a safe environment. As leaders, these instructors have adapted well to the educational environment. They work hard to create support for their unit in the school and in the community. The long hours they spend in community and school service create valuable citizenship and leadership development for the cadets, and bring positive recognition (and often resources) back to the unit. Recommendations are made to disseminate the best practices documented here to JROTC units and to incorporate them in instructor training.

A wide variety of implementations of AES have been proposed, for various desiderata, that effect the S-box in various ways. In particular, the most compact implementation to date of Satoh et al. performs the 8-bit Galois field inversion of the S-box using subfields of 4 bits and of 2 bits. This work describes a refinement of this approach that minimizes the circuitry, and hence the chip area, required for the S-box. While Satoh used polynomial bases at each level, we consider also normal bases, with arithmetic optimizations; altogether, 432 different cases were considered. The isomorphism bit matrices are fully optimized, improving on the ""greedy algorithm."" The best case reduces the number of gates in the S-box by 16%. This decrease in chip area could be important for area-limited hardware implementations, e.g., smart cards. And for applications using larger chips, this approach could allow more copies of the S-box, for parallelism and/or pipelining in non-feedback modes of AES.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |apa/cb  Original.  11/10/04,,,,, 0|aCryptography.; 0|aData encryption (Computer science),,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bNational Security Agency.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2004/NPS-MA-04-001.pdf|z(793 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA427050,,,"  |a*ALGORITHMS, *CRYPTOGRAPHY, OPTIMIZATION, GATES(CIRCUITS), POLYNOMIALS, STANDARDS, INVERTERS.;  |aIDE: ENCRYPTION, RIJNDAEL ALGORITHMS, GALOIS FIELDS, FPGA(FIELD PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAYS), S-BOX ALGORITHMS, ISOMORPHISMS",  |aX0|bAD#,,,

In this paper we develop a dynamic two-level social interaction model where individuals move back and forth between home and daily meeting sites, possibly passing through a general meeting site such as a mass transit system or other crowded areas.

In this report,  the effect of a slow, flat Ricean fading channel on communications systems performance is examined. Since channel fading  significantly degrades the performance of a communication system, the performance of digital communication systems that  also use forward error correction channel coding is analyzed for hard decision decoding and, where appropriate, for soft  decision decoding. Diversity, another technique to mitigate the effect of fading channels on digital communication systems  performance, is also discussed. Also included is a discussion of the effect of narrowband noise interference, both continuous  and pulsed, on digital communication systems. We then discuss the analysis of the probability of bit error for the combination  of error correction coding and diversity. Following this, we briefly discuss spread spectrum systems. Next, we examine the  link budget analysis and various models for channel loss. Finally, we examine in detail the second generation digital wireless  standard Global System for Mobile (GSM).",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |apa  Original  01/12/05,,,,, 0|aDigital communications.; 0|aModulation (Electronics),,,,"1 |aBeltz, Nathan E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2005/NPS-EC-05-002.pdf|z(818 KB),,,,  |aX0|bAD#,,,

The Navy's transformational vision for the future, Sea Power 21, involves Seabasing as a way to address these difficulties by projecting and sustaining joint forces globally from the sea. This study analyzes logistics flow to, within and from a Sea Base to an objective, and the architectures and systems needed to rapidly deploy and sustain a brigade-size force. Utilizing the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), this study incorporates a systems engineering framework to examine current systems, programs of record and proposed systems out to the year 2025. Several capability gaps that hamper a brigade-size force from seizing the initiative anywhere in the world within a 10-day period point to a need for dedicated lift assets, such as high-speed surface ships or lighter-than-air ships, to facilitate the rapid formation of the Sea Base. Additionally, the study identifies the need for large-payload/high-speed or load-once/direct-to- objective connector capabilities to minimize the number of at-sea transfers required to employ such a force from the Sea Base in 10 hrs.

Academics and practitioners stress the criticality of coordinating the efforts of federal, state, local and private sectors. Some barriers to interorganizational collaboration include: missions that are at odds with one another, unclear roles and responsibilities lack of accountability. Managers of homeland security will need to find ways to overcome these barriers and work together more effectively. This project is meant to discover the factors that contribute to and inhibit collaboration. The first phase of the research focused on the development of a conceptual model of interagency collaboration. Phase II was an action-based workshop to gather data from a group of 30 senior homeland security managers. Nine major topics that were central to interagency collaboration were identified in Phase III. We anticipate that these deliverables will be used for future workshops, seminars, short class modules or longer graduate-level courses. Future plans include developing a diagnostic survey.

It categorizes capabilities of various decision aids and correlates these capabilities with the characteristics of specific organizational variables in order to examine the context in which DSS's operate. The concept of the three-dimensional contingency matrix is used as an initial point of model development. Expansion of the matrix to n-dimensional is suggested and n = 6 is used to extend the paradigm. A conceptual six-variables organization framework is proposed where the interrelationships among characteristics of the six variables and general capabilities of decision aiding systems are described by a series of IF...THEN production rules. Finally, data are collected and a computer model based on artificial intelligence heuristics (production systems) is created to examine the consequences of various organization - DSS interactions.

The target audience of the workshops has been 2-year college, 4-year college, and university-level educators who have responsibility for teaching curricula that are, or could be, related to IA issues. Participation by instructors from institutions serving underrepresented groups was high. Attendance at the tutorials was maximized both years. The format for each workshop was three sequential sessions: a tutorial session, a refereed paper session, and a working session. This sequence allowed newer practitioners to become knowledgeable about the basics of IA, provided an opportunity for experienced practitioners to present new ideas for discussion, and allowed both groups to interact in a problem solving context to develop solutions for point issues presented by the workshop. The tutorial sessions, attended by 19 participants in 2003 and 20 participants in 2004, provided education to faculty about the fundamentals of information assurance and computer security and to improve their instructional capability in these areas. The participants indicated that they benefited substantially from both the tutorials and the subsequent gathering of IA educators at the Workshop on Education in Computer Security (WECS).",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aNSF-0210762,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ oclc 6/24/05,,,,, 0|aInformation science.; 0|aData protection.,,,,"1 |aFalby, Naomi B.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aNational Science Foundation.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2005/NPS-CS-05-005.pdf|z(109 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA434035,,,"  |aDATA PROCESSING SECURITY, INSTRUCTORS, WORKSHOPS, INFORMATION SECURITY, INFORMATION ASSURANCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, SCHOOLS, TEACHING METHODS, PROBLEM SOLVING, SYSTEMS ANALYSIS, COOPERATION;  |aIDE: NAVAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL, TUTORIALS, INSTRUCTOR EDUCATION, FACULTY EDUCATION, COLLEGE FACULTY, UNIVERSITY FACULTY",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The mission requires a number of Blue assets; the more assets that can be assembled before the deadline, the greater the possibility of mission success. Traditionally, military Command and Control (C2) has a hierarchical structure; information is centrally stored and decision makers are also centralized. The paradigm of Network-Centric Warfare (NCW) implies a more horizontal C2 structure. There is often little communication infrastructure on the battlefield. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication networks are attractive enablers of a horizontal C2 structure. A stochastic model is used to discuss the benefits and possible vulnerabilities of a P2P-enabled C2 structure for a time-critical mission. The P2P architecture can result in larger probabilities of mission success than centralized C2. However, its benefits are nullified if the time it takes to assemble the needed Blue assets becomes larger than that for the centralized C2.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |apa/dk  Original.  09/19/05,,,,, 0|aMilitary weapons|zUnited States., 0|aUnited States|xArmed Forces|xWeapons systems.,,,"1 |aJacobs, Patricia A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bWayne B.

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War have profoundly changed the nation's security environment. However, as the September 11th attacks demonstrated, new deadly challenges have emerged from terrorist networks and rogue states. Although none of these threats equal the destructive capabilities of the Soviet Union, their determination to obtain, and the greater likelihood that they will use, weapons of mass destruction, creates a more complex and dangerous security environment.  The Department of Defense (DoD) has also entered a transformative period--leveraging emerging technologies to develop a net-centric warfare capability--while actively conducting military operations, throughout the spectrum of conflict, in support of the global war on terror. As a result, DoD is struggling to meet these competing requirements and reconcile the spending between traditional and new programs.Therefore, creating a more efficient acquisition system is a top priority. High-quality research in the area of acquisitions is necessary to catalyze positive and lasting changes to  improve performance, reduce acquisition cycle times, and reduce the costs of DoD acquisitions, even as the Department confronts rapidly changing external and internal environments. This report highlights some the forces that are acting to change the environment including: budget constraints, a changing threat environment, technological innovations, force transformation, human capital management, a shrinking industrial base, and ethics; and then develops a strategy for acquisition research.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |ack/ 3/11/09.;  |apa/pa  Original.  10/06/05,,10|aUnited States.|bDept. of Defense|xManagement.;10|aUnited States.|bDept. of Defense|xProcurement.;10|aUnited States.|bDept. of Defense|xAppropriations and expenditures.,,,, 0|aUnited States|xArmed Forces|xManagement.; 0|aUnited States|xArmed Forces|xProcurement.; 0|aUnited States|xArmed Forces|xAppropriations and expenditures.,,,"1 |aLucyshyn, William.",2 |aUniversity of Maryland.|bCenter for Public Policy and Private Enterprise.|bSchool of Public Policy.;2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,,,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2005/UMD-AM-05-021.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Recently, theater combatant commanders have come to rely on  contingency contracting officers to support coalition forces, and concurrently, to achieve  a transformation of the economic landscape essential for achieving theater objectives.

The Air Force currently spends about one-third of its annual budget on purchased goods and services.  This offers the Air Force a large target in which to seek cost savings.  Commercial firms have moved toward a commodity-council approach for purchasing in recent years, and the cost reductions realized have been impressive.  Findings have shown that the increased leverage from commodity councils will optimize buying power for the Air Force, reduce duplication of effort, improve customer support, and minimize supply-chain costs through integration and collaboration. ?Commodity Council? is a term used to describe a cross-functional sourcing team designed to create a centralized purchasing strategy and establish centralized contracts for enterprise-wide requirements.  The commodity council drives commonality and standardization and ensures the leveraging of purchasing volume.  The key to this approach is to rely on market experts in the specific commodity category to make well informed, market-savvy decisions that fully meet all enterprise-wide requirements for a commodity.  A ?commodity? is simply defined as a segmentable category of goods and/or services.  Note, this definition does not imply an expendable or non-complex item (Hansen 1).

One of the most significant changes has been the emphasis on the use of commercial goods and services coupled with the use of performance-based contracts to satisfy mission-critical needs.  As the performance of contractors has become more critical to the mission, there has been a significant reduction in the number of acquisition personnel available to perform what traditionally has been referred to as contract administration tasks.  In addition, with the increase in the amount of services contracts, there has been a change in the skills needed to manage contracts after award.  Contract administration is currently undergoing a paradigm shift because of changes to what the DoD buys and to how purchases are being made. The move to minimize the importance of detailed specifications and to rely on commercial processes requires more management than administrative skills.  The bottom line is that new methods and skills must be explored and developed to more effectively perform what traditionally has been referred to as ?contract administration.?  This study, which addresses contracts at the micro level, concludes the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 represents a viable framework by which contracts should be structured, as well as managed.  The Act requires managers in the Executive Branch to develop strategic plans and use performance indicators to measure output and to evaluate the outcome of the contract, as well as the contractor?s performance. The study also recommends Kaplan and Norton's Balanced Scorecard method of performance measurement, together with Contractor Performance Information (Past Performance Reporting) requirements, can be adapted to the management of contracts.  Past Performance reporting and tracking requirements define?in general terms?the buyer?s perspective of what is expected from the contractor. The Balanced Scorecard methodology enables managers to then identify the critical success factors and critical measures for each expatiation.  Both parties will benefit by jointly managing these indicators concurrently throughout the life of the contract, rather than reacting to after-the-fact reporting. The goal of such requirements is to add joint accountability for results to the buyer-seller relationship.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ oclc 11/22/05,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2004/NPS-CM-04-011.pdf;41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2004/NPS-CM-04-011.pdf|z(877 KB),,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Yet, in the past few  years we have seen a reversal in the way acquisition professionals view contract  closeout as the least important portion of a contract's life and a wholesale transition to a  renewed emphasis on closing contracts in a timely manner. DOD has even gone so far  as to create specific metrics to track the progress of the Services in closing contracts,  and has focused management attention on the issue.  So what is it that has created this shift in priorities, what are some of the most  glaring problems in tackling contract closeout, and what are some ways of correcting  those problems? These are some of the questions this short article will pose to the  reader, although a detailed rendering of those issues is better within the source material  from which this article was taken.p1s Although this article cannot address all of the  findings from a larger study conducted at the Naval Postgraduate School and published  as an MBA Project Report and an associated Thesis, both published in June 2003, this  article points out many of the problems involved in contract closeout and proposes  potential solutions to address those problems.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ oclc 11/22/05,,,,,,,,,"1 |aBusansky, Michael.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.org/_files/FY2003/NPS-CM-03-002.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

To manage and protect critical data in this regard implies that information systems need to enforce temporal security policies. However, we lack operating system and hardware support for implementing temporal protection mechanisms. A time interval memory protection architecture to support enforcement of temporal policies is presented.  It implements a Time Interval Access Control model in which authorizations are determined by time attributes associated with subjects and objects, and constraints on the relations of those attributes relative to the time of access. The policy is enforced at the memory page level by kernel mechanisms and related hardware extensions. The notion of memory access phases and the principle of efficiently mediated access are articulated to support the analysis of the design.

This is a modern X-band, pulse Doppler radar used by the Army for forward area air defense. An SBIR project funded by the Office of Naval Research resulted in a contract to ProSensing, Inc., Amherst, MA to retrofit this radar with a weather processor. The intent is to provide a military capability to assess battlespace weather in real time. This capability will be developed using the NPS radar as a testbed. When the weather capability has been fully implemented on the NPS radar, it will also have application as a scientific instrument for severe storm research because of its mobility and cutting-edge capabilities. The modified radar has been designated the MWR-05XP (Mobile Weather Radar, 2005, X-band, Phased Array).  This report presents the results of an analysis of numerous aspects of the radar's performance as a weather sensor. The ability of the MWR-05XP radar to detect rain with different levels of reflectivity, the ability of the radar to detect clear air turbulence with different structure parameters and echoes from birds and insects has been examined. Curves are provided to determine correlation and decorrelation times for weather signals with varying rms velocity spread. MWR-05XP post detection integration improvement has been computed for a Rayleigh weather target with varying pulse-to-pulse correlation and curves are provided to determine the improvement in terms of the number of pulses integrated. Lastly, scan strategy is discussed with emphasis on obtaining weather signal parameter estimates with small variance while at the same time achieving a rapid volumetric update rate. Electronic scan is the feature that enables the radar to achieve a rapid volumetric update rate.

This paper presents an analysis of the various issues and parties to the  very creative and innovative financing on behalf of the Navy's Military Sealift Command. Still in existence today, the 1983 contracts  for thirteen TAKX ships were valued at approximately $2.6 billion. While the decision is often framed as a ""lease versus purchase""  choice, the facts indicate that the option to purchase was not seen as viable at the time. In hindsight, the TAKX leasing program was  successful and cost effective, despite the whirlwind of political commentary and intrigue and the dueling quantitative analyses  surrounding it. However, as an unintended (or, perhaps, intended) consequence, laws and policies have since been changed so that  leasing is no longer viable for financing military assets.

The literature review presents the theoretical  framework surrounding the transformation of purchasing to supply management along with its major  developments such as integrated supplier relationships, total ownership costs, cross-functional teams, supply chains, e-procurement systems, and strategic sourcing strategies. Strategic sourcing and  developing sourcing strategies are discussed and include the Kraljic model for determining the best type  of procurement strategy for specific products or services. Commodity sourcing strategies are discussed  in conjunction with Lasseter's seven-step process for developing commodity sourcing strategies. The  application of strategic sourcing in the commercial sector is discussed using examples from industry, along with applications within the Department of Defense. Some challenges to strategic sourcing  identified in the report include access to the required spend data, highly fragmented supply base, and  government procurement goals. The report also identifies best practices such as establishing common  processes and tools, using cross-functional teams, ensuring adequate team sponsorship and authority,  and aggressively managing purchasing requirements. The report concludes that strategic sourcing  initiatives have resulted in significant cost reductions, increases in productivity, quality improvement, and  return on investment.

Shortcomings of predominantly used acquisition approaches, such as the Block approach or Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) to fulfill system requirements, have led to a new approach in Evolutionary Acquisition strategy: a process called spiral development. This research study focuses on the process, promise, and limitations of spiral development. This study is centered on the key issues that distinguish a spiral approach from the traditional approaches implemented by the DoD. This study describes the fundamentals of the process of spiral acquisition: increments, characteristics of the increments, and the capabilities they deliver using a simple model. The interest of this research is in understanding the concept of spiral acquisition as it applies, specifically, to Program Managers. In conclusion, the analysis so far suggests two key issues: the necessity for a template or a set of rules that will aid Program Managers in understanding and implementing the concept of spiral development, and the role of modularity in spiral development.

Based on a review of the logistic measurement, PBL, and behavioral decision making literature, we form four hypotheses about specific impacts of process measures and variance on performance evaluation in PBL. Our first hypothesis is that the difficulty of relating component-level measures to system-level outcomes will lead to an increased use of non-diagnostic or only partially diagnostic process measures. We further propose that these process measures will produce a dilution effect in which system outcomes are undervalued. Our third hypothesis is that absent clear, observable outcome metrics at the component level, decision makers will increasingly rely on measures of inputs as surrogates for outputs. Our fourth hypothesis is that absent a specific guidance on how to value variance, decision makers will tend to overlook this important component of performance.

CAIV includes setting affordability goals, technical versus cost tradeoffs, cost and performance architectures that include production and sustainment costs, and a range of specific practices. Recent research into R-TOC suggests that CAIV efforts may not be taking full advantage of new JROC/JCIDS processes nor engendering full leadership support to reduce O&S costs. The Program Manager (PM) is responsible for developing and managing a TOC plan-with input from key stakeholders such as the sponsor and other users, the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC), and DoD Component and OSD leadership.

Such a situation arises in various military  contexts such as the conduct of air defence by Red in the face of Blue SEAD (suppression of enemy air defences). A class of  decision processes called multi-armed bandits has been previously deployed to develop optimal policies for Red in which she  attaches a calibrating (Gittins) index to each Blue target and optimally shoots next at the Blue with largest index value. The  current paper seeks to elucidate how a range of developments of index theory are able to accommodate features of such  problems which are of practical military import.

This demonstrates that providing special operations personnel with information on radar,  communications and target detection ranges in real time is feasible, as long as basic information (temperature,  humidity, wind speed) is available near the surface in the area of operations. This was the first time for the TNT  project that the radar and optical models were quantitatively compared and analyzed using actual field tests. Not  surprisingly, the model predictions were not accurate to the high degree needed for an operational special forces  situation. The radar ranges were under-predicted. The visibility predictions were greatly improved from the  previous TNT projects, due to the inclusion of human eye factors in addition to atmospheric effects.

Therefore it was necessary to study the CC carefully to determine such requirements for EAL7. A long  list of required documents was developed.

The implications of using a modular open systems approach on the contracting process is then presented, with a focused discussion on the various contracting activities and documents related to each phase of the contracting process. The report uses the generally accepted phases of the contracting process--procurement planning, solicitation planning, solicitation, source selection, contract administration, and contract closeout to discuss the contracting activities and documents that should be affected by using a modular open systems approach. Additionally, a brief highlight of intellectual property issues is provided, along with a review of the applicable major regulatory provisions.

Recent advances in the Real-Time Specification for Java (RTSJ) have resulted in the introduction of new means for creating predictable real-time environments for Java programs. However, these new features also make the Java semantics more complex and the run-time behavior of the Java programs more difficult to analyze. In this technical report, we describe a number of preliminary experiments we performed to study the features of the Sun Java Real-Time System (RTJ 1.0). We designed these experiments to verify the viability of the Real-Time Java language for the implementation of the Global Integrated Fire Control System (GIFC)--a component of the C2BMC element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS). Our preliminary experiment shows that it is preferable to use only the Real-Time Java threads that use the heap memory and not the no-heap real-time threads for the GIFC software. However, such architecture cannot be implemented by using RTJ 1.0. Further experiments are needed to determine if the preferred architecture can be implemented with the upcoming RTJ 2.0, which will give programmers more control over the priority of the garbage collection.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 5/24/06,,,,," 0|aProgramming languages (Computers); 0|aGuided munitions, Precision.",,,,"1 |aCook, Thomas S.;1 |aDrusinsky, Doron.;1 |aMichael, James Bret;1 |aOtani, Thomas W.;1 |aShing, Man-Tak.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aMissile Defense Agency.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-CS-06-010.pdf|z(135 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA449127,,,"  |a*JAVA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, GUIDED MISSILES, DEFENSE SYSTEMS, ANTIMISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, REAL TIME, SEMANTICS",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Of the three BLTs, two of them must be transported by surface craft a distance of no more than 200nm in sea state 4 or less. The two surface bound BLTs need to be loaded onto the transporting craft and delivered to shore, whether it is a port facility or austere beachhead. There is no current or future system of connectors to meet all the time-distance, sea state, and interface flexibility requirements for this aspect of seabasing. To meet these requirements a High Speed Assault Connector (HSAC) is needed which either augments current or replaces existing connector platforms to deliver and support the required forces ashore. The Joint ACCESS is a HSAC that brings the necessary speed, payload capacity, interface capability, and mission flexibility needed to fill the Sea Base to shore transportation gap. With a maximum speed of 43kts and payload capacity of 800LT, 12 Joint ACCESS trimarans can transit 200nm and fully offload in 7 hours. Its beachable design uses a floating bow ramp to reach out to austere beaches, while its combat system suite provides self defense in addition to robust offensive capabilities.",,,,"  |a""See the README file for viewers and systems requirements.""",,  |aTurkish Navy author.;  |aUS Naval Reserve (USNR) author.;  |aTunisian Navy author.;  |aHellenic Navy author.;  |aUS Navy (USN ) author;  |aSpanish Navy  author;  |aChilean Navy author.,,  |adln. oclc. 05/22/06.,,,,," 0|aLogistics, Naval.; 0|aSea-power|zUnited States.; 0|aAmphibious warfare.; 0|aSystems engineering.; 0|aSea control.; 0|aNaval strategy.",,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,40|uhttp://www.nps.edu/academics/gseas/tsse//subPages/2004Project_2.html;40|uhttp://www.nps.edu/academics/gseas/tsse//;40|cFor more information on TSSE go to|uhttp://www.nps.navy.mil/tsse/,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Two sides are always involved, one desiring the unimpeded movement of some commodity, while the other desires the opposite. We consider two distinct situations. The first is motivated by warfare involving Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) directed against the movement of materiel in convoys on roads. It will be assumed that this kind of warfare is low level in the sense of destroying only a negligible fraction of the shipped materiel, so the objective becomes the maximization or minimization of the rate at which the convoys take lethal hits. The second situation is an economic one where the interdictor attempts to capture a significant fraction of the shipped materiel, so much so that a profit cannot be made by shipping it. This leads to a Nash equilibrium where the shipper's quantity shipped is in equilibrium with the interdictor's budget for interdiction.""-- p. i.",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 6/27/06,,,,," 0|aIraq War, 2003-",,,,,"2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aJoint Chiefs of Staff, J-3, DDGO.",,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-OR-06-007.pdf|z(345 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA449515,,,"  |a*INTERDICTION, *TACTICAL ANALYSIS, NETWORK ANALYSIS(MANAGEMENT), LOW INTENSITY CONFLICT, IMPROVISED WEAPONS, IRAQI WAR",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Results indicate that reporting of violent incidents is often incomplete or inaccurate, which impacts the ability to derive certain conclusions. However, the data suggest that sailors in paygrades from E3 to E5  are more likely to be involved in violent incidents, and that alcohol was potentially a factor in at least half the incidents reported.  Additionally, communication on the topic by leaders was found to be important, and implications for communicating about the issues are discussed. Recommendations included developing common standards for reporting violent incidents, engaging in focused prevention measures, giving equal attention to both alcohol misuse and violence prevention, ensuring effective communication, empowering all leaders (E4 to O9) to address violence prevention, delivering training that reaches sailors, requiring units in high OPSTEMPO take additional precautions, requiring that units precede major phase changes with violence prevention messages, continuing holiday-related anti-violence messages, and monitoring new manning units (e.g., Sea Swap) for violence characteristics.""-- p. i",  |aAlso available online.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 8/2/06,,,,," 0|aSailors.; 0|aSociology, Military |zUnited States.",,,,"1 |aKing, Cynthia L.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aThe Commander Third Fleet.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-GSBPP-06-008.pdf|z(591 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA451293,,,"  |a*NAVAL PERSONNEL, *ENLISTED PERSONNEL, *BEHAVIOR, *PATTERNS, *PREVENTION, *ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, DEPLOYMENT, POLICIES, DEMOGRAPHY, HOMICIDE, YOUTH, DRUG ABUSE, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, TENSION, STANDARDS, SEASONAL VARIATIONS, ASSAULT, HIGH RATE, LEADERSHIP",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Such analysis focuses on the processes of change from one organizational form to another and leads to the generation of transformational plans, which can be used by acquisition leaders, practitioners and policy makers to outline steps--and leaps--required to affect fundamental organizational change. We also build upon prior work on computational modeling and experimentation to develop models of the transformation process, and we explore such models to emulate the behavior of the alternate transformational plans noted above. By modeling and experimenting with processes of change, as opposed to processes of ongoing organizational routines, we begin to extend the state-of--the-art in computational modeling and experimentation.

These tools are useful for assessing risk and vulnerability in a broad range of operational situations and in response to a spectrum of threat scenarios. Of particular interest to both military and homeland-defense analysts is the combined shore-side and water-side protection of naval and harbor facilities.  In August of 2005, the NPS MOVES Institute was funded by the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center (NFESC) to investigate and develop such an analytic tool. This report describes the work accomplished during Phase II of the Modeling and 3D Visualization for Evaluation of Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Alternatives project in order to achieve that goal.  Waterside protection includes surveillance (detection and assessment), delay (e.g., barriers), and warning and response means (e.g., patrol craft). The purpose of the Phase II effort was to develop an analysis tool that supports assessment of the effectiveness of various sensor, barrier, and response systems to enable decision-makers to make good judgments on what to purchase and employ. For example, if there is no physical barrier in a port to protect naval assets then when does a threat need to be detected to permit sufficient time to intercept/neutralize and how many patrol craft and/or weapon stations are needed to provide an acceptable level of protection? Alternatively, if a barrier is employed that effectively stops all small boats for a designated period of time, then when does detection need to occur and how many patrol boats are needed for the same level of protection? With various surveillance system assets (including surface and/or subsurface sensors), how much time is available between detection/reporting and response?  The selection of effective combinations of sensors, barriers, and response systems requires a tool that can represent all these various assets and physical factors, providing insights into the most effective combinations that provide an acceptable level of protection at the least cost (in terms of manpower and dollars) and least risk (in terms of lives and infrastructure).""--p. i.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 11/30/06,,10|aUnited States.|bDept. of Homeland Security.,,, 0|aCoast defenses.,,,,"1 |aBlais, Curt.;1 |aNorbraten, Terry.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bNaval Facilities Engineering Command.|bWestern Division.;2 |aNaval Modeling and Simulation Office.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-MV-06-002.pdf|z(4.17 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA458494,,,"  |a*TEST AND EVALUATION, *COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION, *DEFENSE SYSTEMS, *NAVAL SHORE FACILITIES, *HARBORS, *HOMELAND DEFENSE, *PORTS(FACILITIES), SCENARIOS, THREATS, INTERCEPTION, PATROL CRAFT, RISK ANALYSIS, COUNTERTERRORISM, SURVEILLANCE, VULNERABILITY, THREE DIMENSIONAL, BARRIERS, PROTECTION, AREA SECURITYZTEST AND EVALUATION, *COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION, *DEFENSE SYSTEMS, *NAVAL SHORE FACILITIES, *HARBORS, *HOMELAND DEFENSE, *PORTS(FACILITIES), SCENARIOS, THREATS, INTERCEPTION, PATROL CRAFT, RISK ANALYSIS, COUNTERTERRORISM, SURVEILLANCE, VULNERABILITY, THREE DIMENSIONAL, BARRIERS, PROTECTION, AREA SECURITYZ;  |aIDE: *HARBOR DEFENSE, M&S(MODELING AND SIMULATION), SHORE-SIDE PROTECTION, WATER-SIDE PROTECTION, NAVAL FACILITIES, HARBOR FACILITIES, ATFP(ANTI-TERRORISM FORCE PROTECTION), *INSTALLATION SECURITY ASSESSMENT, DES(DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION), DOE(DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS)",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

We then identify enablers and barriers that contribute to collaborative capacity. A diagnostic process based on the established practices of organization development is offered to guide the design of tailored assessments of collaborative capacity. We present a comprehensive set of both interview and survey questions, based on our model, which can be used in creating a collaborative capacity audit.

Overhead, friendly (Blue) sensors (S) patrol the domain and classify (perhaps incorrectly) detected vessels of interest as R or W. The misclassification of a W as an R is a false positive. An overhead sensor follows (or tracks) any vessel it classifies as R until it is relieved by another platform, perhaps a destroyer pair (DD). The overhead sensor is here assumed unable to detect and classify additional vessels while it is following a suspicious vessel; this may well be a somewhat pessimistic assumption, very possibly ""richer possibilities"" based on additional assets (such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)) are available, but loss of track may occur as well as misclassification.  Deterministic and stochastic models are formulated and studied to evaluate the probability that Rs are successfully neutralized before reaching their destination. The model results quantify the effect of the resources and time needed to prosecute misclassified Ws (false positives) on the probability of successfully neutralizing R.  The results indicate that the probability of neutralizing an R vessel is very sensitive to the false positive rate.

The literature review presents the theoretical  framework surrounding the transformation of purchasing to supply management along with its major  developments such as integrated supplier relationships, total ownership costs, cross-functional teams, supply chains, e-procurement systems, and strategic sourcing strategies. Strategic sourcing and  developing sourcing strategies are discussed and include the Kraljic model for determining the best type  of procurement strategy for specific products or services. Commodity sourcing strategies are discussed  in conjunction with Lasseter's seven-step process for developing commodity sourcing strategies. The  application of strategic sourcing in the commercial sector is discussed using examples from industry, along with applications within the Department of Defense. Some challenges to strategic sourcing  identified in the report include access to the required spend data, highly fragmented supply base, and  government procurement goals. The report also identifies best practices such as establishing common  processes and tools, using cross-functional teams, ensuring adequate team sponsorship and authority,  and aggressively managing purchasing requirements. The report concludes that strategic sourcing  initiatives have resulted in significant cost reductions, increases in productivity, quality improvement, and  return on investment.

The Army's current Small UAV requirements are based upon the Future Combat System's Operations Requirements Document and has not been validated at the platoon or company level. The Raven SUAV is a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) item that swiftly became the Army's Small UAV of choice for operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Doctrine and Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTP) have been written for the Raven SUAV; however, it is not standard practice for all units operating the system abroad. The last review of the SUAV operational requirements was conducted in 2003 but did not specifically address its usage on the battlefield. In an attempt to fill that gap, this project focuses on real-world usage of the Raven SUAV system. We compare doctrine versus practice using the Department of Defense's (DOD) Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership, Personnel, Facilities (DOTML-PF) model as the primary logic construct. The report begins by providing a background of the Raven SUAV, to include its evolution from a COTS item to the Army's SUAV of choice, and how it has impacted the warfighter. Next, the authors provide an overview of DOTML-PF in order to provide a basis for comparing doctrine and practice.

The unplanned, immediate joint fire support requests, and the architectures that enable the rapid  pairing and tasking of fire support providers to fulfill those requests, were the emphasis of the study. Through  modeling, simulation, and qualitative assessments of existing and planned command and control systems and  organizations, a Centralized Joint Fire Support Network that incorporates and consolidates the various crossservice  fire support functions, was chosen as the preferred evolutionary development path to a fully Distributed  Joint Fire Support Network.

PPP agreements have provided the UK increased capabilities.  Also, this research provides an in-depth analysis of Private Financed Initiatives (PFI) that Serco, Inc., has undertaken. Finally,  this research evaluates the increases in value-for-money resulting from the PPP transfer of risk to the private sector.  The research concludes that PPPs should be continued and expanded to provide increased real-time capability to the  DoD while supporting private industry. Since the government has the lowest cost of borrowing, PPPs agreements may not  appear to be cost effective as a means of procurement. However, the benefits from transferring risk to the private sector can  more than offset the higher financing cost. PPPs reallocate risk and up-front capital requirements, allowing the government to  spread program cost over time. Without initial capital outlays, the government can acquire higher priority goods and services with  its limited resources. In addition, PPPs provide the government with an increased infrastructure and technological capability than  would otherwise not be available.""-- p. i.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 12/15/06,,,,, 0|aPolitical science.; 0|aArmed Forces |x Appropriations and expenditures.,,,,"1 |aSummers, Donald E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-GSBPP-06-020.pdf|z(225 KB),,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This research explores the possibility of expanding the use of PPPs to enhance the DoD  combat and combat-support functions. First, to better understand how PPPs function (the partnership relationships and financing  arrangements), we examine Hannon Armstrong's ""fee for service contract"" solution to the lack of appropriated funds for establishing  a vital fiber-optic link near the Arctic Circle.  Next, we explore the history of Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) and  their potential application to re-engining the Air Force's B-52H through PPPs. Historically, this program has only been used for fixed  assets, not mobile assets like engines. There is little debate over the success of ESPC contracts in reducing energy consumption,  but their use in DoD mobile assets is new. Finally, we conclude that applying ESPCs to mobile assets has the potential to reduce  energy consumption, save millions of dollars and increase combat efficiency.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 12/15/06,,10|aUnited States.|bDept. of Defense.,,, 0|aPrivatization.,,,,"1 |aSummers, Donald E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-GSBPP-06-021.pdf|z(457 KB),,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Sea Enterprise contracted the Center for Defense Management Reform to research transformation and benchmarking best practices in the private sector. The aim of this research is to help Sea Enterprise understand, design and implement its agenda for organizational change. This report presents a brief recent history of management reform within the Department of Defense and a summary review of current business management transformation initiatives in the DoD and in the services. Then, a survey of the scholarly and practitioner literature on organizational change explores the questions of first-order and second-order change, and looks at models of incremental, episodic and continuous change. Next, this report examines various types of benchmarking and identifies benchmarking candidates from both private- and public-sector organizations categorized by distinctive best practices that may be applicable to Sea Enterprise. The report concludes that further in-depth benchmarking by matching Sea Enterprise with specific organizations could contribute to the success of Sea Enterprise.

Using PPI as a factor in all source selections was a tactic modeled after industry best practices. The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) envisioned that industry PPI collected by Federal agencies would eventually be  automated, maintained on secure databases, and available to all Government agencies for source-selection purposes. This practice would eventually lead to efficiencies similar to those in the private sector. However, along the way, Government and private sector industry have begun to disagree about how PPI is collected and how PPI is used.

They are stepping out of the Industrial Age of warfare and into the Informational Age of warfare.  Network Centric Warfare (NCW) is the emerging theory to accomplish this undertaking. NCW describes ""the combination of  strategies, emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures, and organizations that a fully or even partially networked force can  employ to create a decisive war fighting advantage."" 1 This theory is turned into a concept through Network Centric Operations  (NCO) and implemented through the FORCEnet operational construct and architectural framework. The coalition navies are  moving in a direction to develop and leverage information more effectively and efficiently. This will lead to an informational  advantage that can be used as a combat multiplier to shape and control the environment, so as to dissuade, deter, and decisively  defeat any enemy.  This analysis was comprised of defining three TTCP AG-6 provided vignettes into ARENA model that captured Coalition ESG  configurations at various FORCEnet levels. The results of the analysis demonstrated that enhanced FORCEnet capabilities such  as FORCEnet Levels 2 and 4 would satisfy the capability gap for a needed network-centric ESG force that can effectively  counter insurgency operations in Maritime warfare. Furthermore, the participating allied navies in the Coalition ESG should  pursue acquisition strategies to upgrade their ship platforms in accordance with our recommendation which indicates that  FORCEnet Level 2 is the best value.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 1/29/07,,,,, 0|aInformation warfare.; 0|aCounterinsurgency.,,,,"1 |aRomero, Eric.;1 |aTimm, Joel.;1 |aGorsch, Jeffrey.;1 |aBarron, Clara.;1 |aNantasenamat, Arkapol.;1 |aJung, Vincent.;1 |aSanchez, Mario.;1 |aNguyen, Michael.;1 |aNguyen, Michelle.;1 |aTan, David.;1 |aMetaferia, Tewodros.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-SE-06-003.pdf|z(4.23 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA460906,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

These  systems may be based at sea, on land or in the air, and provide fire control solutions that match sensed threats to  available weapons throughout the battle space. Using a unique methodology, the project provides the following: 1)  characterization of the battle space 2) description of the design principles applied and 3) a conceptual design. The  conceptual design is then modeled using ARENAª simulation software in an attempt to validate the proposed  architecture. The project concentrates on implementing three very specific scenarios: Engage on Remote (EOR),  Forward Pass (FP), and Remote Fire (RF). These concepts are applied to the FORCEnet Open Architecture  Domain Model using legacy and future Naval systems such as AEGIS Cruisers and Destroyers, DD(x), CG(x),  Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), and Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System  (JLENS). As a part of the above scenarios, the presentation will address specifics on best shooter selection. The  resulting functional architecture and data flows transform concepts into real engagement methods. These methods  will match the Detect-Control-Engage (DCE) sequence with Observe-Orient-Decide and Act (OODA), and  employ current methods of data fusion from various platforms to provide a true integrated fire control solution.  Combat identified threats on the network can then be matched to any available weapons on the network, and the  preferred shooter selected can efficiently engage the threat. Thus, the effective and efficient use of all sensors and  weapons available in the battle space becomes possible.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 1/29/07,,,,, 0|aComputer programming |vSoftware.; 0|aBattlefields.,,,,"1 |aDeering, Viviane.;1 |aGrates, Patrick.;1 |aHedge, Tom.;1 |aKung, Sein.;1 |aMartinez, Maria.;1 |aMcarthy, Percival.;1 |aPugh, Kevin.;1 |aRadojkovic, Sasha.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-SE-06-002.pdf|z(2.15 MB),,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Hence, efficient logistics systems, including transportation, inventory management, modifications and maintenance activities, are critically important for containing the lifecycle costs of weapon systems and for maintaining the highest level of military readiness given the extant fiscal constraints. This paper will describe Lean Six Sigma (LSS), a strategically important and proven logistics initiative for both reduced lifecycle costs and improved readiness.  With aging weapon systems, the US Department of Defense is facing ever-increasing military expenses to maintain military readiness. Hence, the Department of Defense is keenly interested in implementing Lean Six Sigma in all the services. In this paper, we present an overview of Lean Six Sigma methodologies, describe Lean Six Sigma implementations with a focus on military applications, and discuss managerial guidelines for successfully implementing Lean Six Sigma.

It has been recognized that perhaps the key element in protecting the continental United States  from terrorist threats is obtaining intelligence of impending attacks in advance. Enormous amounts of resources are currently  allocated to obtaining and parsing such intelligence. However, it remains a difficult problem to deal with such attacks once  intelligence is obtained. In this context, the Maritime Threat Response Project has applied Systems Engineering processes to  propose different cost-effective System of Systems (SoS) architecture solutions to surface-based terrorist threats emanating  from the maritime domain. The project applied a five-year time horizon to provide near-term solutions to the prospective  decision makers and take maximum advantage of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions and emphasize new Concepts of  Operations (CONOPS) for existing systems. Results provided insight into requirements for interagency interactions in support  of Maritime Security and demonstrated the criticality of timely and accurate intelligence in support of counterterror operations.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 3/8/2007,,10|aUnited States.|bDept. of Homeland Security.,,, 0|aSystems engineering.; 0|aMaritime terrorism|zUnited States|xPrevention.,,,,"1 |aKessler, Andrew.;1 |aShewfelt, Michael.;1 |aDavis, Jennifer.;1 |aConnett, Brian.;1 |aChiu-Rourman, Jared.;1 |aOravec, Joseph.;1 |aWark, Shaunnah.;1 |aNg, Ling Siew.;1 |aLim, Seng Chuan.;1 |aChua, Cheng Lock.;1 |aYeo, Eng Choon.;1 |aLee, Kok Long.;1 |aChew, Heng Hui.;1 |aLim, Kwang Yong.;1 |aTean, Ee Shen.;1 |aHo, Sze Tek.;1 |aChung, Koh Choon.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2006/NPS-97-06-004.pdf|z(12.2 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA462563,,,"  |a*SYSTEMS ENGINEERINGZSYSTEMS ENGINEERINGZ, *TERRORISMZTERRORISMZ, *HOMELAND DEFENSEZHOMELAND DEFENSEZ, *HOMELAND SECURITYZHOMELAND SECURITYZ, *WATERWAYSZWATERWAYSZ, INTELLIGENCEZINTELLIGENCEZ, SAN FRANCISCO BAYZSAN FRANCISCO BAYZ, MODELSZMODELSZ, MARITIME INDUSTRYZMARITIME INDUSTRYZ, HARBORSZHARBORSZ;  |aIDE: *MARITIME SECURITY, *MARITIME TERRORIST THREATS, MTR(MARITIME THREAT RESPONSE), SOS(SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS)",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This MSSE  Capstone Project investigated the feasibility of integrating the Non-Line of Sight Launching  System (NLOS-LS) onto U.S. Navy ships. In particular, the focus of the project was on the  DDG-51 class ships. The NLOS-LS was originally designed to provide support to Army  ground forces against over the horizon threats. The U.S. Navy recognizes the prospect of this  weapon in an at-sea environment. The capability of the system has been proven through its  developmental testing to date and illustrates the potential to the U.S. Navy for ship defense.  System integration involves incorporating a stand-alone, land-based system onto a ship with an  existing shipboard combat system. This report addresses the top-level integration issues, such  as the physical installation and combat system integration, and provides recommendations  related to some important concerns that include interface analysis, functional analysis, system  behavior, and physical installation. This analysis concludes with a notional implementation for  many issues and provides a risk analysis for those issues.

Relatively open discussions on core  nuclear issues were held, positive signs on a number of regional topics were visible, and promising avenues for  future discussions emerged.  The goal of this series of annual meetings has been to identify important misperceptions regarding each  side's nuclear strategy and doctrine and highlight potential areas of cooperation or confidence building measures  that might reduce such dangers. Beyond that, the conference aims to deepen American understanding of the way  China views nuclear weapons, the domestic debates that shape those views, and the degree to which there is  change in strategy, doctrine, and force posture in Beijing. Both of the first two meetings have focused their  discussions on general perceptions of the utility of nuclear weapons, the nature of current nuclear strategy and  operational concepts of each side, regional issues pertaining to nuclear weapons issues, and prospects for  cooperation with regard to specific policy areas.

Ethnic background (white-nonwhite) and sex were additional parameters. While negligible differences were found on the learning test between groups differentiated on ethnic background or sex, significant differences favoring white and males were found on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT)--a general aptitude composite formed from the ASVAB and used to derive cutting scores for entry into the Armed Services. The best predictor of the learning test score among the 12 tests of the ASVAB and the AFQT composite was the General Information (GI) test. The AFQT was also a reliable predictor, but only for whites. Analysis of the relationships suggested that the learning test was measuring a portion of the large, general intelligence component known to underlie the ASVAB tests and composites. The learning test appeared to measure this pervasive factor better than the AFQT over the entire range of abilities found in this sample. The results suggest that there may be many capable individuals being eliminated in selection programs using psychometric cutting scores of general cognitive ability or intelligence. Those being adversely impacted in this age group are not only the culturally disadvantaged and persons whose first language is not English, but females in general.

Our experiment shows that it is possible to use only the Real-Time Java threads that use the heap memory for the GIFC software. SUN RTJ 2.0 gives programmers more control over the priority of the garbage collection. We developed a real-time monitor design pattern to support the implementation of time-constrained computations that use the heap memory, and a methodology to determine the RTS run-time parameters (thread priorities, memory usage, process load, and task deadlines) necessary for the timely execution of these time-constrained computations.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 7/10/07,,,,, 0|aComputer programming|vSoftware.; 0|aSoftware engineering.; 0|aProgramming languages (Electronic computers),,,,"1 |aAuguston, M.;1 |aCook, T.

The  Riverine Sustainment 2012 Team (RST) examined the cost and performance of systems of systems which increased RF  sustainment in logistically barren environments. RF sustainment was decomposed into its functional areas of supply, repair,  and force protection. The functional and physical architectures were developed in parallel and were used to construct an  operational architecture for the RF. The RST used mathematical, agent-based and queuing models to analyze various supply,  repair and force protection system alternatives.  Extraction of modeling data revealed several key insights. Waterborne heavy lift connectors such as the LCU-2000  are vital in the re-supply of the RF when it is operating up river in a non-permissive environment. Airborne heavy lift  connectors such as the MV-22 were ineffective and dominated by the waterborne variants in the same environment. Increase in  manpower and facilities did appreciable add to the operational availability of the RF. Mean supply response time was the  biggest factor effecting operational availability and should be kept below 24 hours to maintain operational availability rates  above 80%. Current mortar defenses proposed by the RF are insufficient.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 7/10/07,,,,,,,,,"1 |aGalli, Michael.;1 |aTurner, James M.;1 |aOlson, Kristopher A.;1 |aMortensen, Michael G.;1 |aWharton, Neil D.;1 |aWilliams, Evertt C.;1 |aSchmitz, Thomas F.;1 |aMangaran, Matthew C.;1 |aNachmani, Gil.;1 |aKiat, Cheng Hwee.;1 |aSeng, Goh Choo.;1 |aLeong, Ho Chee.;1 |aMeng, Hui Kok.;1 |aLeong, Lim Han.;1 |aHwee, Lim Meng.;1 |aYen, Mak Wai.;1 |aSim, Phua Poh.;1 |aMin, Ong Hsueh.;1 |aPond, Eric L.;1 |aSundram, Joshua G.;1 |aLeng, Tan Boon.;1 |aMoh, Tan Kian.;1 |aHon, Teng Choon.;1 |aPoh, Yow Thiam.;1 |aShan, Ong Wing.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aMeyer Institute of Systems Engineering,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-97-07-004.pdf|z(6.90 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA469560,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Realizing that ships are  most vulnerable while in-port, adequate measures must be employed by port facilities to ensure vessel security.  Commercial and naval ports have been set as a national priority in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 13. A  successful terrorist strike against a port could produce long-term economic impact. In an attempt to develop a  system of systems to prevent and defeat terrorist attacks against foreign and domestic ports, this study approached  the threat from three different aspects: terrestrial, seaborne, and internal. This report uses the Systems Engineering  Design Process to define the problem, generate alternatives, model scenarios, and analyze results to produce  feasible and cost-effective solutions. No single system can address all issues prevalent in the port security  problem. The recommended solutions individually address specific threats, namely vehicle-borne improvised  explosive devices, small boat swarm tactics, importation of contraband or weapons of mass destruction, and  employee sabotage. Although each solution effectively increased port security, improved port security measures  resulted in greater cost. Some solutions yielded only marginal gain in effectiveness with drastic increases in cost.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 7/10/07,,,,, 0|aTerrorism |z United States |x Prevention.; 0|aHarbors |x Security measures |z United States.,,,,"1 |aAmes, Morgan.;1 |aChan, Chun Man.;1 |aChng, Kim Chuan.;1 |aCole, Andrew.;1 |aJohnson, Dale.;1 |aKwai, Kiah Wen.;1 |aKoh, Kim Leng.;1 |aLim, Horng.;1 |aLim, Thiow Yong.;1 |aLiu, Yilei.;1 |aMarsh, Alan.;1 |aMcRoberts, Claude.;1 |aNg, Chee Wai.;1 |aNg, Chee Wan.;1 |aNg, Min Yew.;1 |aNguyen, Henry.;1 |aOkruhlik, Laura.;1 |aOh, Pei Tze.;1 |aOng, Kar Leong.;1 |aPeh, Lin Kiat.;1 |aSoh, Wei Ting.;1 |aTan, Chee Leong.;1 |aToh, Leng Huei.;1 |aTorian, Joseph.;1 |aWong, Yi Jim.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aWayne E.

This workshop  was held 14-15 November 2006 at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) in Monterey, California, USA.  The main goal in the creation of an Extensible 3D (X3D) Earth will be achieved by Web3D Consortium members  who are preparing to build a standards-based suite of software tools usable by governments, industry, scientists, academia and  the general public. X3D mappings of world terrain, cartography and imagery will be made available for use in any scene,  making it easy to geospatially reference and share X3D models. Open standards, the Web architecture, utilization of the  Extensible Markup Language (XML) and open protocols will be leveraged throughout. Both commercial and open-source  software codebases will be able to utilize these best practices and contribute to these shared assets.  The goal of this technical requirements workshop was for participants to identify and prioritize the technical  requirements, available capabilities, open challenges and strategic partnerships needed for a Web3D working group to execute  this ambitious project. Emphasis was placed on extensibly adapting existing resources and in cooperation towards achieving  shared goals, especially with other open geospatial organizations and standards. These workshop results document participant  contributions, next-step activities and goal milestones.  The workshop concluded that X3D Earth is feasible and that the effort can be started now. Many resources are  already available, yet work will be needed to make them compatibly available. No showstoppers were discovered; a nice  surprise after so many diverse inputs. Finally, lots of collaboration and coordinated work are needed to proceed successfully in  order to build a web-services infrastructure and develop a server-side specification to enable X3D Earth.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 8/10/07,,,,, 0|aCybernetics.; 0|aComputer programming|vSoftware.,,,,"1 |aSadagic, Amela.;1 |aNorbraten, Terry.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aDTO-CASL.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-MV-07-003.pdf|z(4.84 MB),,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

One countermeasure against  such attacks is adding a random mask to the data; this randomizes the statistics of the calculation at the  cost of computing ""mask corrections."" The single nonlinear step in each round of the AES algorithm is  called the ""S-box,"" which involves the greatest computational cost in a round (to find the inverse in the  Galois field), as well as the greatest cost for mask corrections. Oswald et al.[9] showed how the ""tower  field"" representation allows maintaining an additive mask throughout the Galois inverse calculation.  This work combines that masking approach with the compact S-box of Canright, to give a masked Sbox  that requires minimal circuitry, and hence the chip area.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ 08/15/07,,,,, 0|aComputer programming|vSoftware.; 0|aCybernetics.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-MA-07-002.pdf|z(192 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA471345,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Acoustic data collection consisted of  recordings at a site on the continental shelf to the west of Cape Elizabeth and another in deep water within  Quinault Canyon. An analysis plan for acoustic data is included. Results for 32 visual surveys are presented as  tables and charts for pinnipeds, dolphins, porpoises, and whales. Time series of vocalizations detected in acoustic  recordings are presented for killer whales, white-sided dolphins, Risso's dolphins, unclassified dolphins,  humpback whales, and sperm whales. Visual sightings show clear differences in locations, reflecting preferred  habitats as well as providing information on seasonal occurrence of some species. Preliminary comparison of  acoustic and visual data sets reveals interesting patterns. For example, humpback whales are most commonly seen in summer and fall throughout the visual survey region, yet song and feeding calls of these whales are heard  almost exclusively in fall and winter. First steps in the development of a predictive habitat model for cetaceans are  described. Continued visual and acoustic data collection is recommended.

It is asserted that the very early system design modeling tasks are typically not given adequate stress, with the result that poor system designs are carried forward into the mid design phases. A lack of suitable modeling tools is likely one reason, and so an ADA-like modeling technique is proposed. It has many of the properties of specification languages, including the ability to be machine processed to indicate incomplete or inconsistent systems. The unclassified portions of the SPY-1 radar component of the AEGIS weapon system is used as a test vehicle to illustrate the modeling technique.

Current US naval weapon systems lack full interoperability across multiple platforms and full integration of detection, control, and engagement processes against incoming targets. The key to defeating future threats to our military assets is in gaining additional reaction time. This can be accomplished by leveraging collective sensor detection data throughout the battlespace, utilizing the FORCEnet data resources to evaluate the threat, and engaging the threat with a tiered defense. The objective of this capstone project is to address the above issues through the use of Open Architecture (OA) within a FORCEnet environment. This report focuses on the development of a conceptual architecture for Cruise Missile Defense (CMD) that combines FORCEnet architecture requirements with Program Executive Office of Integrated Warfare Systems (PEO IWS)'s OA functional architecture technical requirements. Further, this conceptual architecture is compared with PEO IWS's functional architecture via a series of systems engineering diagrams. These diagrams culminate in a simulation model that analyzes and determines the validity of the conceptual architecture. Results from the simulation model show that the conceptual architecture performed significantly better than PEO IWS's. These results are attributed to the addition of a re-engagement loop called Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA).",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 10/23/07,,,,, 0|aCruise missiles.,,,,"1 |aCamacho, Juan G.;1 |aGuest, Lawrence F.;1 |aHernandez, Belen M.;1 |aJohnson, Thomas M.;1 |aKang, Alan H.;1 |aLe, Giang T.;1 |aMacGillivray, Brian J.;1 |aNgo, Tu K.;1 |aNorman, Kyle B.;1 |aTomei, Franklin.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-SE-07-004.pdf|z(6.07 MB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aDEFENSE SYSTEMS, CRUISE MISSILES, OPEN SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE, INTEGRATED SYSTEMS , GUIDED MISSILE DETECTION , DIAGRAMS , REACTION TIME;  |aIDE: FORCENET, OA(OPEN ARCHITECTURE), CMD(CRUISE MISSILE DEFENSE), IWS(INTEGRATED WARFARE SYSTEMS)",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Accordingly, we note that cost overruns remain a well documented  and significant problem for DoD, and consider why that problem continues. We review the current state (and limitations) of  DoD cost estimation methodology and Transaction Cost Economics (TCE). We then consider reasons why including TCE explanatory  variables might (or might not) improve cost estimation. To explore the potential contribution of TCE variables, we considered two cases of  Army surface-to-surface missiles: Javelin and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS); we also analyzed standard program cost data  bases for indications of transaction costs. While the case studies indicated that TCE variables have promise in improving the explanatory  power of cost estimates, the standard data bases are poorly designed (at best) to shed light on program transaction costs. Our policy  conclusion is that the complete costs of major transactions together with key characteristics of the market, need to be captured and  understood in order to properly anticipate the full costs of major defense acquisition programs.",  |aAlso available in print..,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 12/4/07,,,,,,,,,"1 |aAngelis, Diana I.;1 |aFranck, Raymond.;1 |aMelese, Francois.;1 |aDillard, John.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-GSBPP-07-008.pdf|z(431 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA473417,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

One  method for this is passive acoustic monitoring, which has primarily been used for baleen whale vocalizations.  However, baleen whales are only a small fraction of marine mammals, whereas the greatest public concern and  possible impact to Navy operations now centers on odontocetes, particularly beaked whales. Accordingly, passive  acoustic monitoring techniques need to be extended to odontocetes. This report documents the compilation of an archive of existing beaked whale recordings, and summarizes the deliberations/discussions at a meeting in Boston  (Sept. 2006) to determine (or, at least, reach consensus of) how the content, structure, and format of that archive  should look.

The 2007 workshop focused on requirements, particularly the process of transforming vague and uncoordinated needs of individual stakeholders into consistent and well-defined requirements that are suitable for supporting automated and computeraided methods for engineering subtasks in the subsequent development process.  Innovations are effective technology transfers of sound inventions. The workshop case study was targeted at identification and  assessment of sound inventions of technology that can be used to support innovations in requirement engineering. For example,  we wanted to gain a better understanding about how to deal with natural language as the vehicle from which we derive  system/software requirements, how to use intelligent agents as entities to facilitate semi-automatic requirements-documentation  analysis, and how to build automatic systems to aid in requirements/specifications elicitation.

Modeling and  simulation tools were used to project the performance of three existing alternatives and two new alternatives. A Life Cycle  Cost Estimate (LCCE) was generated for each alternative. An Analysis of Alternatives compared performance and cost. The  Joint Test and Evaluation Methodology Capability Test Methodology (JTEM CTM) was projected to provide slightly better  performance than other alternatives, at the median LCCE. The results were a recommendation to monitor JTEM CTM as it  completes development, and employ the JTEM CTM in a C4I SoS evaluation to confirm its estimated cost and performance.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aSystems engineering.,,,,"1 |aAcosta, Jacob.;1 |aMedina, Jorge.;1 |aHoesly, Scot.;1 |aNguyen, Michael.;1 |aHuseth, Scott.;1 |aPatel, Jaykant.;1 |aKrider, Steven.;1 |aRangi, Kamaljit.;1 |aLamb, Jeremy.;1 |aSchoen, Tim.;1 |aMartin, Calvin.;1 |aTrinh, Khai.;1 |aWillis, Ronald.;1 |aMedina, Vince.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aSystems Engineering Department (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-SE-07-006.pdf|z(2.85 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA472716,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aCOMMAND CONTROL COMMUNICATIONS, SYSTEMS ENGINEERING, TEST AND EVALUATION, COST ESTIMATES,  JOINT MILITARY ACTIVITIES, LIFE CYCLE COSTS Identifiers:;  |aIDE: C41(COMMAND CONTROL COMMUNICATIONS COMPUTERS AND INTELLIGENCE), SOS(SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS), JC3M(JOINT C4I CAPABILITY CERTIFICATION MEASURES), LCCE(LIFE CYCLE COST ESTIMATE), JTEM CTM(JOINT TEST AND EVALUATION METHODOLOGY CAPABILITY TEST METHODOLOGY)",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Each lamina is treated as an orthotropic material under plane stress state and are assumed to be transversely isotropic. Four stiffness properties, (E1, E2, n12, G12), are treated as design variables for minimization of a performance index. The differences between analytically obtained and experimental natural frequencies for the specimen, along with a proper weighting scheme for each mode, are minimized using the optimization routine, 'fmincon' in the MATLABª optimization toolbox. The modal assurance criterion is utilized to construct the weighting to express the degree of correlation between mode shape vectors obtained experimentally and derived analytically.  This study requires a series of experimental results; natural frequencies and corresponding mode shapes of the specimen. A computational tool has been developed as a result of this study. Numerical examples are investigated to demonstrate the performance of this approach. Further study with experiments may show practical benefit of current method for characterization of mechanical properties of advanced composite materials",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 12/5/07,,,,,,,,,"1 |aGordis, Joshua H.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-MAE-07-003.pdf|z(790 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

One of the major impediments to using alternative forms of procurement financing for acquiring defense capabilities is in the budgetary treatment, or ""scoring,"" of these initiatives by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the congressional Budget Committees. The current scoring policy that has been applied to many initiatives essentially negates the advantages from using alternative forms of financing. Therefore, this research examines existing policies and their adherence to statutes. It also investigates the recording methods of the various government organizations and committees and their documentation of obligations and outlays related to financing alternatives used by federal agencies. Preliminary evidence suggests that this emerging topic has major importance for future DoD acquisitions in a resource-constrained environment. Included are recommendations for changes in budgetary scoring that encompass the full scope of federal obligations and expenditures while promoting efficient, more rapid and fiscally responsible acquisitions.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aSan Miguel, Joseph G.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-GSBPP-07-011.pdf|z(157 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA475519,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aPROCUREMENT, FINANCE, FEDERAL BUDGET, CONGRESS, DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, POLICIES, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT , ORGANIZATIONS , ACQUISITION , DEFENSE SYSTEMS",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

A comprehensive formulation for finite element modeling of biological tissues was developed. The mesh is  voxel-based, and is generated automatically from CT scans. CT data from live, frozen, and thawed specimens of  Tursiops truncatus showed similar results in tissues and organs for the following quantities: geometry, absolute  density, and sound velocity. Simulated sound sources placed inside and outside of modeled adult male Cuvier's  beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris) revealed pathways for acoustic propagation into and out of the head. The  simulations indicated a new ""gular pathway"" for sound reception. Propagated sound pressure waves enter the  head from below and between the lower jaws, continuing toward the bony ear complexes through the internal  mandibular fat bodies.",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aFunding number: N00244-06-C-0030.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 1/9/08,,,,, 0|aBeaked whales.; 0|aBaleen whales.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-SE-07-M01.pdf|z(1.74 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA475190,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aSOUND TRANSMISSION, BEHAVIOR, HABITATS, NOISE(SOUND), HEAD(ANATOMY), ANATOMICAL MODELS, WHALES, COMPUTERIZED SIMULATION, TISSUES(BIOLOGY), ACOUSTIC VELOCITY, COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY, ORGANS(ANATOMY), CALIFORNIA GULF, HEARING, SOUND PRESSURE, UNDERWATER ACOUSTICS, RECEPTION, SOUND WAVES, FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS, FIELD TESTS.;  |aIDE: BEAKED WHALES, BALEEN WHALES, WHALE SIGHTINGS, WHALE DISTRIBUTION, VOCALIZATIONS, FIELD STUDIES, HABITAT MODELING, CETACEANS, ODONTOCETE, MARINE HABITATS, BEAKED WHALE ANATOMY, SOUND RECEPTION MODELING, SOUND GENERATION MODELING, TURSIOPS TRUNCATUS, BIOLOGICAL TISSUE MODELING, ZIPHIUS CAVIROSTRIS, GULAR PATHWAY, VIBRO-ACOUSTIC TOOLBOX",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Our completed research defined the operational and technical requirements for the system, called the  Digital Array Radar for BMD and Counter-stealth (DARBC). Initial analysis included characterization of the  threat and definition of the Concept of Operations (CONOPS). Basic operational Key Performance Parameters  (KPPs) were defined. Based on a notional ballistic missile Radar Cross Section (RCS), a radar technical  parameters study derived the technical requirements for the radar necessary to meet the KPPs. Related research  topics included radar parameter sensitivity, cooling, search pattern options, Electronic Attack (EA), ship flexure,  topside array layout, supportability, and cost.

Low junior officer retention is a concern, particularly with respect to SWO women--whose numbers  have steadily declined since the repeal of the Combat Exclusion Act in 1994.  Studies conducted in this area have found that family-related factors, as well as leadership and culture factors (including morale  and lack of mentoring), push both men and women out of the Navy. Nonetheless, the Navy's primary effort to improve retention has been to  introduce the Surface Warfare Officer Continuation Pay (SWOCP) in 1994 and, subsequently, to offer a Critical Skills Retention Bonus.  Retention bonuses have not offset the non-monetary concerns, particularly for women. The present study focuses on the non-monetary  factors that have received little attention in the past with respect to changes that could be made to improve retention. The findings apply to  both men and women.  Unlike previous studies that have assessed intentions of SWOs to stay or leave, the current study is based on a survey of officers  who have actually made the decision to leave active duty and who are now in the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR).  The data show that family-related factors are the highest-rated influences on the decision to leave active duty; this holds true for  both men and women and older vs. younger year groups. Women felt more strongly than men about the influence some of these factors  had on the decision to leave active duty, but the similarity between the opinions expressed by men and women was surprising. Further,  monetary incentives have less influence on retention than family or leadership factors. ""Total military pay"" was more important to men than  to women, but still placed lower on the list than many other factors that caused men to leave active duty.  Other findings are reported that concern mentoring, gender issues, feelings about the separation decision, and incentives that  could encourage this group to consider returning to active duty. More women than men would consider returning, and improvements in  leadership were mentioned most often by all groups as a change that needs to be made to improve retention. Finally, recommendations are  made for training interventions and research to address leadership issues.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 3/11/08,,,,,,,,,"1 |aCrawford, Alice.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-GSBPP-08-009.pdf|z(347 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Deep foraging dives (>800 m) occurred at similar rates during the day and night for Blainville's beaked whales (daymean=0.38 h-1; nightmean=0.46 h-1), and there were no significant diel differences in depths, durations, ascent or descent rates for deep dives. Dives to mid-water depths (100-600 m) occurred significantly more often during the day (mean=1.59 h-1) than at night (mean=0.26 h-1). Series of progressively shallower bounce dives were only documented following deep, long dives made during the day, while at night whales spent more time in shallow (<100 m) depths. Significantly slower ascent than descent rates were found following deep foraging dives both during the day and night. Similar patterns were found for the Cuvier's beaked whales. These results suggest that so-called bounce dives do not serve a physiological function, although the slow ascents may. This diel variation in behavior suggests that beaked whales may spend less time in surface waters during the day to avoid near-surface, visually-oriented predators, such as large sharks or killer whales (Orcinus orca).",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aFunding code: N6227106MPRR403.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 4/15/08,,,,, 0|aBlainville's beaked whale.; 0|aWhales.,,,,"1 |aBaird, Robin;1 |aWebster, Daniel L.;1 |aSchorr, Gregory S.;1 |aMcSweeney, Daniel J.","2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aCNO/N45, Washington, D.C.",,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008//NPS-OC-08-001.pdf|z(198 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA475545,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Spectral and temporal properties are analyzed for the echolocation clicks from short-beaked common, long-beaked common, Risso's, Pacific white-sided and bottlenose dolphins. Two of the species exhibit unique spectral peaks and notches when the complete click is analyzed. A nested ANOVA analysis indicates that spectral peaks and notches occurring between 24 and 35 kHz are distinct between the two species and exhibit low variation within each species. Also, two subgroups are distinguished within Pacific white sided dolphin recordings, possibly representing two overlapping populations in the region. Bottlenose and common dolphin clicks do not exhibit consistent patterns of spectral peaks or notches.  Visual and acoustic line-transect surveys during four CalCOFI cruises (July 2006 --  April 2007) were conducted to understand cetacean ecology and habitat. The most commonly sighted mysticetes were blue, fin, gray and sperm whales; most commonly sighted odontocetes were short-beaked common dolphins and Dall's porpoise.

It was speculated that the negative correlation with chl a might be due to a lag from primary to secondary productivity: as phytoplankton are eaten by zooplankton (which in turn become available to whales), the overall amount of chl a decreases.  It is recommended that in collaboration with other agencies hydrophones be deployed in the northeastern Gulf of Alaska to provide current information on the occurrence of vocally active whale species, including low frequency baleen whales and higher frequency odontocetes.

The Dialogue is organized by the Naval Postgraduate School and Pacific Forum-CSIS and is funded and guided by the Advanced Systems and Concepts Office of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency.  The goal of this series of annual meetings has been to identify important misperceptions regarding each side's nuclear strategy and doctrine and highlight potential areas of cooperation or confidence building measures that might reduce such dangers. Beyond that, the conference aims to deepen American understandings of the way China views nuclear weapons, the domestic debates that shape those views, and the degree to which there is change in strategy, doctrine, and force posture in Beijing. Both of the first two meetings had focused their discussions on general perceptions of the utility of nuclear weapons, the nature of current nuclear strategy and operational concepts of each side, regional issues pertaining to nuclear weapons issues, and prospects for cooperation with regard to specific policy areas. (Conference reports from the first two meetings were published previously and are available from NPS at either the FOUO or unclassified level from this author.)

This study presents the results of a follow-up survey of this population of UAS crewmembers who were supporting ""reachback"" teleoperations using a modified rotational shift work schedule. Specifically, shift work-related increases in fatigue, sleepiness, and risk for performance decrements were examined. Shift system features and individual and situational differences associated with fatigue were also explored.

Multi-core processors, due to their wide adoption, impressive performance, and low cost, are very attractive platforms for computation. Unfortunately, highly secure processing of sensitive information on such platforms is extremely difficult to achieve due to extensive resource sharing and the lack of strong security primitives.  In this paper we propose that commodity integrated circuits, with some very minor modifications, could be enhanced with a separate silicon layer used to enforce strong isolation, reference monitoring, and other useful security properties.  A separate layer, stacked using 3-D integration, allows us to decouple the function and economics of high assurance policy enforcement mechanisms from the underlying high-performance computing  hardware. We describe 3-D integration, how the host layer may be modified, and as our working example, we   show how the problem of cache-based side channels can be addressed by re-routing signals from the computation layer through a cache manager in the control layer.",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aGrant number: CNS-0524707.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 5/28/08,,,,, 0|aIntegrated circuits.; 0|aMicroprocessors.,,,,"1 |aHuffmire, Theodore.;1 |aLevin, Tim.;1 |aIrvine, Cynthia.;1 |aNguyen, Thuy.;1 |aValamehr, Jonathan.;1 |aKastner, Ryan.;1 |aSherwood, Tim.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aNational Science Board (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2007/NPS-CS-07-016.pdf|z(1.02 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA482458,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aINFORMATION ASSURANCE, SECURITY, THREE DIMENSIONAL, MICROPROCESSORS, INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, LAYERS, PROCESSING, ISOLATION, SENSITIVITY, SHARING, SILICON, SUPERVISORS, RESOURCES, PARTS, COMMODITIES, TRANSISTORS, PERFORMANCE(ENGINEERING), MONITORING, LOW COSTS, ECONOMICS, COMPUTATIONS, CORES;  |aIDE: HIGH ASSURANCE, MULTILEVEL SECURITY",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Space-based interceptors possess certain kinematic advantages over ground-based interceptors in defeating an ICBM threat during boost phase. This paper explores the performance of various guidance laws that might be used by an exo-atmospheric kill vehicle (EKV) launched from a space platform to defeat a hostile, ground-launched ICBM during boost phase. Proportional navigation guidance, bang-bang guidance and predictive guidance are all investigated using simulated missile and EKV trajectories. Performance results are presented with respect to miss distance, intercept time, launch envelope, and total control effort. The total control effort is directly related to fuel consumption, and smaller values translate to less weight in fuel or longer potential intercept ranges. Large launch envelopes mean fewer required EKV carriers. In general, the predictive guidance algorithm outperformed the other guidance algorithms in these simulations, but it did prove to be sensitive to timeto- go errors.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aJang, Sang-Keun.;1 |aPace, Phillip E.;1 |aHutchins, Robert G.;1 |aMichael, James Bret",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bMissile Defense Agency.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-CS-08-009.pdf|z(1.54 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA481330,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The two major areas of experimentation for FBE-J were Sea- based Joint Forces Maritime Command and Control (JFMCC), and Assured Access. FBE-J was an opportunity to experiment with JFMCC across all maritime warfare areas in a difficult littoral environment. The experiments were conducted from 24 July to 15 August 2002 in the U.S. western sea and land ranges. FBE-J used a mix of live and simulated activities to examine operational and tactical warfighting issues in a real environment. There were periods during the experiment when FBE-J operated independent of the joint environment. At such times, Navy simulation provided Red-Force activities. At the service level, simulation was used to examine systems that did not yet exist, to fill out orders of battle, and to determine effects due to force numbers. Specific FBE-J activities were as follows: refine the roles, functions, and planning process for the Joint Force Maritime Component Commander; refine C4ISR and support for a sea-based Joint Force Commander; develop innovative solutions to the seams between forward-based forces and rear-echelon forces through innovative networking; provide field-tested Naval Fires Network TACMEMO for fleet use; refine the concepts of employment for distributed, networked, manned, and unmanned platforms, and remote sensors, for anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, and mine warfare; examine multi-mission pull and joint C2 of Navy Theater Ballistic Missile Defense capable units; examine coordination from theater ASW commander to local ASW commander in integrating unmanned sensors and platforms with manned sensors and platforms; examine joint tactical packages to counter a swarming small boat threat; refine concepts of employment for organic and dedicated mine warfare forces in assured access mission; and integrate kinetic and non-kinetic engagement options to develop computer network defense CONOP7.",  |aAlso available online.;  |aCD-ROM.,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.;  |aSystem requirements: CD-ROM reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aNaval art and science|zUnited States.; 0|aSea-power|zUnited States.; 0|aNaval strategy.,,,,"1 |aSchacher, G.

The NUWC Division Newport cohort applied the disciplined practice of systems engineering processes to analyze and improve upon Anti-Submarine Warfare effectiveness in support of Carrier Strike Group operations. The cohort sought customer feedback to understand and formalize the perceived needs and formulate and rank candidate solutions to meet these needs. The systems engineering team, seeking solutions that provide improved Carrier Strike Group defense from undersea threats, generated 14 alternative architectures for analysis. The alternatives that passed feasibility screening underwent performance and cost modeling, reliability screening, and risk analysis to help provide a basis for comparison. The analysis demonstrated that a distributed barrier of active sensors placed and maintained by a Littoral Combat Ship provided an effective detection and engagement solution. The team further concluded that coupling the barrier  with development of advanced capability improvements to the platform-based active sonar provided an effective layered defense approach.

NPS is designing CubeSats and a structure to deploy them in orbit as part of its emphasis on hands-on education This technical report deals with the development of a CubeSat Launcher (NPSCuL). NPSCuL will carry up to ten P-PODs built and flight qualified by CalPoly. It will be launched into orbit and deploy multiple CubeSats. Several designs have been developed including finite element models each with a variable number of elements and shell wall thicknesses and tested to loads of 15 g. The simulation results show that the aluminum structures need to have a minimum shell thickness of 15 mm to handle the maximum expected stress. Different bolt patterns for the connection between the structure and the base plate were analyzed. A circular bolt pattern is preferred because the stress is distributed more evenly over the bolts but the shell thickness was modified based on the results from the frequency analysis.,  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ orginal 9/9/08,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bSpace Systems Academic Group.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008//NPS-SP-08-001.pdf|z(2.08 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA476837,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aLAUNCHERS, MATHEMATICAL MODELS, FREQUENCY, SIMULATION, THICKNESS, EDUCATION, STUDENTS, CIRCULAR, STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING, BOLTS, FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS, STRUCTURES, SHELLS(STRUCTURAL FORMS), ALUMINUM, PATTERNS, WALLS",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The program is in its fifth year of System Development and Demonstration. Despite two restructures, due to reprioritizations of dollars within the Army and budget cuts imposed by Congress, the program remains on schedule to deliver capability to the current force in 2010 and, by 2017, to field a fully equipped FCS brigade combat team. To date, most articles, studies, and reports on FCS have focused on the complexities of the task of developing and fielding a system-of-systems and on the unique contractual arrangement between the Army and the program's lead system integrator.

The hope is that these suppliers would compete on price, transactions  would be automated and low cost, and as a result, the price of goods and services would fall. Numerous Internet marketplaces came into  being during the Internet boom; however, an almost equal number disappeared following the Internet bubble burst. Still, many survive today  based on a variety of models that are quite successful. If a right model is selected, it could help large organizations, like the DoD, achieve  great efficiencies for their acquisition and procurement processes.  The objective of the paper is to examine models for classifying and differentiating the business functionality provided by Internet marketplaces and to investigate the impact of the various models on government and DoD acquisition. The models will consider such variables as types of goods and services purchased, how these goods and services are purchased, pricing mechanisms, the characteristics of the markets, and ownership of marketplace.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,10|aUnited States. $bDept. of Defense.,,, 0|aAutomation.; 0|aElectronic commerce.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-GSBPP-08-004.pdf|z(118 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA476934,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aACQUISITION,  ELECTRONIC COMMERCE,  DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, AUTOMATION,  LOW COSTS, PROCUREMENT,  EFFICIENCY,  MODELS,  ORGANIZATIONS.;  |aIDE: INTERNET COMMERCE, INTERNET MARKETPLACE",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The analysis compared retention rates between those personnel who have been deployed via IA to equivalent cohorts of Navy personnel who have not been on an IA deployment. Retention rates were compared in three different ways: aggregate comparisons, comparisons by individual demographic categories, and comparisons based on standard statistical modeling techniques (logistic regression), in order to simultaneously control for all the demographic and other observable characteristics.  Overall, the analysis found little evidence that IA deployment is hurting retention rates among those who have experienced one or more IA deployments. In fact, in almost all of the comparisons, the retention rates of those who have had one or more IA deployments were higher than the retention rates of their Navy colleagues who have only been on conventional Navy deployments. The only categories where lower retention rates were definitively identified were for E-3s and E-4s, though the decrease in retention rates was only about one percent.",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aFunding number: N6822107WRA0007.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 9/10/08,,,,,,,,,"1 |aButtrey, Samuel E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-SE-08-004.pdf|z(924 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The risk is even greater if the data being stored, processed and transmitted by the mobile device is classified. The purpose of the SecureCore research project is to investigate fundamental architectural features required for the trusted operation of mobile computing devices so the security is built-in, transparent and flexible. A building block for the SecureCore project is a Least Privilege Separation Kernel (LPSK). The LPSK together with extension modules provides the security base.

NPS is now designing CubeSats and a structure to deploy them in-orbit as part of its emphasis on hands-on education.  This technical report deals with the simulation of the deployment and orbit operations of the NPSSCAT CubeSat. With the help of the AGI Satellite Tool Kit software,  animations are created that show the full mission of the CubeSat beginning with the launch and the deployment from the NPS CubeSat Launcher. The animations are combined into one movie, which can be used to visualize the project more  easily and clearly. In addition to the animations, on-orbit systems operations such as power and communication profiles are analyzed. A MATLAB program uses the calculated data to generate the battery state of charge, so it can be determined whether the solar cells are producing enough power for the satellite. For the chosen reference mission, the results of the orbital lifetime calculation show that this CubeSat would only stay in orbit for about six months.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 9/10/08,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-SP-08-002.pdf|z(2.32 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA485343,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aLAUNCH VEHICLES, COMPUTER PROGRAMS, DEPLOYMENT, EDUCATION, PROFILES, SOLAR CELLS, BATTERY CHARGERS, COMMUNICATION AND RADIO SYSTEMS, LIFE CYCLES, BUDGETS, LIFE SPAN(BIOLOGY), SPACE MISSIONS, SPACE LAUNCHED, SPACEBORNE, ORBITS, MOTION PICTURES, SIMULATION;  |aIDE: CUBESAT PROJECT",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The rationale behind this system of preventive detention is to incapacitate suspected terrorists, facilitate  interrogation, and hold them when traditional criminal charges are not feasible for a variety of reasons. While the rationale for  preventive detention is legitimate and the need for preventive detention real, the current Administration's approach has been  reactionary, illogical, and probably unconstitutional.  This paper explores the underlying rationales for preventive detention as a tool in this war on terror; analyzes the  legal obstacles to creating a preventive detention regime; discusses how Israel and Britain have dealt with incapacitation and  interrogation of terrorists; and compares several alternative ideas to the Administration's enemy combatant policy under a  methodology that looks at questions of lawfulness, the balance between liberty and security, and institutional efficiency. In the  end, this paper recommends using the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to monitor a narrow regime of preventive  detention only to be used under certain prescribed circumstances where interrogation and/or incapacitation are the  justifications.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 9/10/08,,,,, 0|aPreventive detention.; 0|aTerrorism |xPrevention.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aCenter for Homeland Defense and Security (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-NS-08-003.pdf|z(752 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA485116,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,"  |aTERRORISTS, COUNTERTERRORISM, PRISONERS, INCAPACITATION, LEGISLATION,  INTERROGATION, UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, PREVENTION,  UNITED KINGDOM,  CRIMINOLOGY, LAW ENFORCEMENT, ISRAEL, ENEMY, THREAT EVALUATION,   TERRORISM,  NATIONAL SECURITY,  PALESTINIANS;  |aIDE: PREVENTIVE DETENTION, ENEMY COMBATANTS, UNLAWFUL COMBATANTS, NATIONAL SECURITY COURT, FISC(FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE COURT), LEGAL ISSUES, LAWFULNESS, UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, INSTITUTIONAL EFFICIENCY, DECA(DETENTION OF ENEMY COMBATANT ACT), PADILLA V HANFT, HAMDI V RUMSFELD, AL-MARRI V WRIGHT, COURT CASES, COURT DECISIONS, AL QAEDA, TALIBAN",  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This paper evaluates the shortcomings that hinder quick and effective space-based support to the U.S. Military and Intelligence Community. The current space community is fragmented; preventing quick, unified decisions, and does not have the executive clout necessary to lead effectively. Our group's solution creates a Department of Space at the cabinet level. The Department of Space will unify the space community, promoting quicker decisions with one common and consistent vision. This change would enable unified plans and policies as well as allow one organization to prioritize all of the space programs.

Since the 1991 Gulf War, there has been a growing dependence on the capabilities and support delivered by those programs to meet requirements of non-strategic users. The current National Security Space (NSS) architecture makes it rather difficult and challenging for all but critical strategic users to fully capitalize on the available assets. Timelines that were once adequate to deliver strategic capabilities are now not sufficient to allow a broader range of users to realize the benefit from using the available space systems. In addition, the non-strategic users run into challenges when they attempt to change the tasking requirements that would enable them to receive associated products / services that are useful and timely.  With the identified gaps in the current NSS environment, the Integrated Product Team (IPT), consisting of ten active duty military students, sought solutions to make space more ""Operationally Responsive"" to its customers by 2025. Due to limited time and assets, the IPT narrowed the focus of the project to the four Joint Publication (JP) 3-14 ""Joint Doctrine for Space Operations"" mission areas of Space Support, Space Control, Force Enhancement, and Force Application.  During this project, the IPT defined Operationally Responsive Space (ORS) from its perspective, developed the requirements to meet the identified NSS gaps, selected the final alternatives to satisfy those  requirements, and suggested an implementation plan. While in the architecture process, the IPT conducted an in-depth evaluation of the original [61] alternatives based on Responsiveness, Risk, Capability, and Cost. After building a foundation for further analysis, a total of 16 alternatives were chosen for the final ORS architecture.  The IPT's leading alternative that provided the most responsiveness was to create a Single Space Agency. The other alternatives range from establishing joint ventures with other countries to developing hypersonic lift vehicles to transport troops and supplies.

Considerable progress has been made toward this goal as a  result of this exercise.  A variety of surface environmental measurements were performed to characterize the conditions  associated with IEDs and the accompanying changes to the local soil conditions. These were complimented by  operational aircraft imaging measurements (movies) of various simulated IED and non-IED targets. These  measurements will be used to improve the physics used in IED detection numerical models. Although analysis of  these data are just beginning, the authors and collaborators have already verified that IED locations can be  detected from high-flying aircraft sensors by the thermal and visible signatures of disturbed soil and other changes  in the local environment.

The team developed a 'baseline' vision for deeper analysis focused on the Combatant Commander supported by analytical categories named 'Pillars as follows: Improved Organizational Relationships, Asset Loss Mitigation, Availability, Flexibility, and Streamlined Acquisition Processes. These pillars allowed the solutions, material and non-material, to be organized for further  analysis, relevancy, and value to the architecture. Constraints and alternative solutions were considered. Analysis was further supported by a performance versus cost process which provided a final test of solution feasibility. Relative cost was determined by comparison of existing program or like capabilities with future inflation. Differing combinations of solutions could provide ORS value by modification of the metrics.

Various existing and proposed FELs are studied, in both amplifier and oscillator configurations. Comparisons to experimental  results show good agreement in each case.  At the outset of this project, short Rayleigh length (SRL) optical cavities were proposed to reduce the optical intensity on the mirrors. Contrary to conventional wisdom, our simulations showed that an SRL FEL would have good gain and power extraction. This was recently confirmed experimentally at Jefferson Laboratory.  System sensitivity to misalignments and distortions are also studied, and tolerance limits are established for tilts and shift of  various components such as the mirrors, electron beam, and magnetic quadrupoles. These tolerances have already been readily achieved in laboratories using active alignment.

DL programs have various delivery methods using either  asynchronous (email, Web, videotape) or synchronous (Video teleconferencing,  Elluminate) communications technologies. There are several potential benefits of DL,  such as reaching students who do not have easy access to education, providing flexibility  in class meeting times, mass delivery of education, improving the quality of learning as  compared to traditional classroom-based instruction, and ultimately preparing students  for a knowledge-based society. However, limitations and concerns are also evident in this  new learning environment. Many challenges associated with DL focus on faculty issues  and concerns.

A wide variety of implementations of AES have been proposed, for various desiderata,  that effect the S-box in various ways. In particular, the most compact implementation  to date of Satoh et al.[12] performs the 8-bit Galois field inversion of the S-box using  subfields of 4 bits and of 2 bits. This work describes a refinement of this approach  that minimizes the circuitry, and hence the chip area, required for the S-box. While  Satoh[12] used polynomial bases at each level, we consider also normal bases, with  arithmetic optimizations; altogether, 432 different cases were considered. The isomorphism  bit matrices are fully optimized, improving on the ""greedy algorithm."" The best  case reduces the number of gates in the S-box by 20%. This decrease in chip area could  be important for area-limited hardware implementations, e.g., smart cards. And for  applications using larger chips, this approach could allow more copies of the S-box, for  parallelism and/or pipelining in non-feedback modes of AES.",,,,  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aCryptography.; 0|aData encryption (Computer science),,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bNational Security Agency.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2005/NPS-MA-05-001.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The purpose of MDA is to generate actionable intelligence obtained via the  collection, fusion and dissemination of information from U.S. joint forces, U.S.  government agencies, international coalition partners and commercial entities. This  actionable intelligence is the cornerstone of successful counterterrorist and maritime law  enforcement operations and is critical to Maritime Security [Morgan and Wimmer, 2005].  The U.S. Navy, as a partner in the development and creation of MDA, has tasked  its subordinate commands to identify and define capabilities to support this program.

Two scenarios  were developed to exercise the system: a surprise assault from a number of personal  watercraft and a saturation assault in which approximately fifty craft of varying sizes  attack. Results from these scenarios were analyzed for system bottlenecks and  recommendations were made to improve decision making processes and reduce  engagement time.

All these events had a pronounced negative effect on the general living conditions and led to a reduction of life expectancy, a sharp increase of morbidity and mortality, and harmful genetic aftereffects for the populations involved. National health and life expectancy have improved considerably since then; however, the author's analysis of the situation is still helpful for modern risk and safety considerations. Part I is a detailed analysis of the risk of death for the population of the Russian Federation due to disease, exposure to natural and man-made environments, professional and non-professional activity, and various social factors. Part II studies radiation exposure databases from Chernobyl, radioactive contamination from long-term operation of large radiochemical atomic plants, and the impact of atmospheric nuclear tests. The author proposes a new approach to raidation risk assessment, which is based on consideration of the distribution of both radiation doses and individual variations in radiosensitivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1 |aUnited States.|bDefense Threat Reduction Agency.;2 |aITT Corporation.,,,,,,,,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Analysis of the attitudes revealed by the survey indicated that although the majority of officers are satisfied to some extent with procedures now utilized in the evaluation system and the performance ratings they have received, a substantial number seemed to be in favor of a number of changes. By and large, this trend is related to grade-the higher the grade, the greater the satisfaction with the status quo.

Shortcomings of predominantly used acquisition approaches, such as the Block approach or Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) to fulfill system requirements, have led to a new approach in Evolutionary Acquisition strategy: a process called spiral development. This research study focuses on the process, promise, and limitations of spiral development. This study is centered on the key issues that distinguish a spiral approach from the traditional approaches implemented by the DoD. This study describes the fundamentals of the process of spiral acquisition: increments, characteristics of the increments, and the capabilities they deliver using a simple model. The interest of this research is in understanding the concept of spiral acquisition as it applies, specifically, to Program Managers. In conclusion, the analysis so far suggests two key issues: the necessity for a template or a set of rules that will aid Program Managers in understanding and implementing the concept of spiral development, and the role of modularity in spiral development. This research.;  |aThe following article is taken as an excerpt from the proceedings of the annual Acquisition Research Program. This annual event showcases the research projects funded through the Acquisition Research Program at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate School. Featuring keynote speakers, plenary panels, mulitiple panel sessions, a student research poster show and social events, the Annual Acquisition Research Symposium offers a candid environment where high-ranking Department of Defense (DoD) officials, industry officials, accomplished faculty and military students are encouraged to collaborate on finding applicable solutions to the challenges facing acquisition policies and processes within the DoD today. By jointly and publicly questioning the norms of industry and academia, the resulting research benefits from myriad perspectives and collaborations which can indentify better solutions and practices in acquisition, contract, financial, logistics and program management.

Gone from memory is the early 1980's controversial Navy leasing program of  Maritime Pre-positioned Ships that had a different result. This paper presents an analysis of the various issues and parties to the  very creative and innovative financing on behalf of the Navy's Military Sealift Command. Still in existence today, the 1983 contracts  for thirteen TAKX ships were valued at approximately $2.6 billion. While the decision is often framed as a ""lease versus purchase""  choice, the facts indicate that the option to purchase was not seen as viable at the time. In hindsight, the TAKX leasing program was  successful and cost effective, despite the whirlwind of political commentary and intrigue and the dueling quantitative analyses  surrounding it. However, as an unintended (or, perhaps, intended) consequence, laws and policies have since been changed so that  leasing is no longer viable for financing military assets. The case presented here considers altering existing laws and regulations to  once again permit leasing of military resources.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,  |ack/ 3/11/09.,,,,,,,,,"1 |aShank, John K.;1 |aSummers, Donald E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aPEO SHIPS.;2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy.

Existing practices in procurement may often be sufficient to assure an adequate supply, but they are not sufficient to assure an adequate supply of technology-based, mass-produced goods. An example of such a technology-based, mass-produced good is body armor. A proposed best practice in technology acquisition is early licensing of technologies underlying such goods. This paper explores the advantages of using early licensing to assure that supplies of technology-based goods are adequate to meet demand;  |aThe following article is taken as an excerpt from the proceedings of the annual Acquisition Research Program. This annual event showcases the research projects funded through the Acquisition Research Program at the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy at the Naval Postgraduate School. Featuring keynote speakers, plenary panels, mulitiple panel sessions, a student research poster show and social events, the Annual Acquisition Research Symposium offers a candid environment where high-ranking Department of Defense (DoD) officials, industry officials, accomplished faculty and military students are encouraged to collaborate on finding applicable solutions to the challenges facing acquisition policies and processes within the DoD today. By jointly and publicly questioning the norms of industry and academia, the resulting research benefits from myriad perspectives and collaborations which can indentify better solutions and practices in acquisition, contract, financial, logistics and program management.

Shortcomings of predominantly used acquisition approaches, such as the Block approach or Pre-planned Product Improvement (P3I) to fulfill system requirements, have led to a new approach in Evolutionary Acquisition strategy: a process called spiral development. This research study focuses on the process, promise, and limitations of spiral development. This study is centered on the key issues that distinguish a spiral approach from the traditional approaches implemented by the DoD. This study describes the fundamentals of the process of spiral acquisition: increments, characteristics of the increments, and the capabilities they deliver using a simple model. The interest of this research is in understanding the concept of spiral acquisition as it applies, specifically, to Program Managers. In conclusion, the analysis so far suggests two key issues: the necessity for a template or a set of rules that will aid Program Managers in understanding and implementing the concept of spiral development, and the role of modularity in spiral development.

Through the analytic form of analysis known as the Knowledge Value Added (KVA) methodology, this thesis will identify a technique to measure the performance of knowledge assets. The resulting values can be compared in varying notional scenarios to assess potential improvements for knowledge-intensive processes. This method of analysis will demonstrate how reengineered processes enable organizations to reduce costs, and maximize knowledge creation and production capacity. A Proof of Concept was developed to analyze the long-established Shipyard planning yard processes, which supports maintenance and modernization of the U.S. Navy Fleet. With these baseline processes as the cornerstone for academic analysis, the KVA methodology shows iterations of varying scenarios using automated data capture and collaborative technology, and the return each provides.

To achieve this goal, organizational modeling was employed to evaluate how changes to the organizational structure of the Lemoore AIMD affected engine throughput time.  Data collected to build the organizational model was acquired via interviews with AIMD personnel.  A baseline model of the AIMD organization was developed for the purpose of modeling the organization's current structure and performance.  The actual, real-world duration required to conduct F414 maintenance was compared to the duration predicted by the model and determined to be within 3%.  Once confidence was gained that the baseline model accurately depicted the organization's actual F414 maintenance performance, modifications or interventions to the model were made to evaluate how organizational changes would affect F414 maintenance duration.  Interventions included paralleling the tasks associated with accomplishing administrative paperwork when initially receiving the F414 engine, and tasks associated with on-engine maintenance, combining personnel positions, adding personnel, and modifying the duration and frequency of meetings.

We conducted interview and surveys in a major military acquisition program office employing IPTs, Alpha Contracting and collocation.  We found that the relationship between formalization and trust was different between government and contractor team members.

Gone from memory is the early 1980's controversial Navy leasing program of  Maritime Pre-positioned Ships that had a different result. This paper presents an analysis of the various issues and parties to the  very creative and innovative financing on behalf of the Navy's Military Sealift Command. Still in existence today, the 1983 contracts  for thirteen TAKX ships were valued at approximately $2.6 billion. While the decision is often framed as a ""lease versus purchase""  choice, the facts indicate that the option to purchase was not seen as viable at the time. In hindsight, the TAKX leasing program was  successful and cost effective, despite the whirlwind of political commentary and intrigue and the dueling quantitative analyses  surrounding it. However, as an unintended (or, perhaps, intended) consequence, laws and policies have since been changed so that  leasing is no longer viable for financing military assets. The case presented here considers altering existing laws and regulations to  once again permit leasing of military resources.;  |aThe following article is taken as an excerpt from the proceedings of the annual Acquisition Research Program.

The  results of the research demonstrated that the ""leave and layer"" approach for incrementally replacing AEGIS system modules was the most  valuable strategic option, providing the highest return on investment with the lowest risk.  This study measured the operational value of various system replacement options from an end-user perspective, identified areas  of deficiencies in capabilities, and flagged areas for potential system improvements and acquisitions. The potential costs and cost savings  for each option were also calculated.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |akmc/kmc oclc 3/11/09.,,,,,,,,,"1 |aUchytil, Joseph.;1 |aHousel, Thomas.;1 |aHom, Sandra.;1 |aMun, Johnathan.;1 |aTarantino, Eric.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aAcquisition Research (Graduate School of Business and Public Policy.

In an attempt to develop a system of systems architecture to defeat mines and Maritime IEDs (MIED), the project team developed several system alternatives, or Adaptive Force Packages, that incorporate both existing systems and emerging technologies. Overall performance was assessed using a US Joint Forces Command sponsored wargame simulating an MIED attack on ports based on the geography of Seattle and Tacoma. A critical analysis of the alternatives based on performance, suitability, cost, and risk were carried out. The study results showed that increases in performance are attainable with  mixed results in cost and risk, and highlighted necessary actions and considerations that must be taken by military and civilian leaders in order to adequately prepare for and counter MIEDs in U.S. Ports.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 3/16/09,,,,,,,,,"1 |aCausee, Christopher.;1 |aEllis, Mark.;1 |aJimenez, Rich.;1 |aTyler, Dan.;1 |aCheng, Hua-Lim.;1 |aNilsson, Julio.;1 |aRowden, Bobby.;1 |aWheatly, Joel.;1 |aWinn, Eric.;1 |aSmith, Tim.;1 |aHellard, Mark.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aSystems Engineering Analysis Cohort 14,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-SE-08-010.pdf|z(3.14 MB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

These subjects are trusted not to conduct malicious activity or degrade system security. We present a formal definition for trusted subject behaviors, which depends upon a representation of information flow and control dependencies generated during a program execution. We describe a security Domain Model (DM) designed in the Alloy specification language for conducting static analysis of programs to identify illicit information flows, access control flaws and covert channel vulnerabilities. The DM is compiled from a representation of a target program, written in an intermediate Implementation Modeling Language (IML), and a specification of the security policy written in Alloy. The Alloy Analyzer tool is used to perform static analysis of the DM to detect potential security policy violations in the target program. In particular, since the operating system upon which the trusted subject runs has limited ability to control its actions, static analysis of trusted subject operations can contribute to the security of the system.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 3/16/09,,,,,,,,,"1 |aShaffer, Alan B.;1 |aAuguston, Mikhail.;1 |aIrvine, Cynthia E.;1 |aLevin, Timothy E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of Naval Research.;2 |aNational Science Foundation.|bOffice of Naval Research.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-CS-08-015.pdf|z(661 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

If it is mounted within a spinning tubular projectile, the ball can serve as an automatic obturator--plugging the projectile while the two bodies are within the gun barrel and rotating to open the tubular passage following exit from the muzzle. The motion of the ball is gyrodynamic in nature and highly dependent upon the external moments on the ball that arise because of its motion relative to the spinning cavity. This report presents the results of an analytical and experimental study to provide an understanding of such motions in as complete a sense as is possible. The general equations of motion are formulated together with appropriate mathematical expressions for the external moments. These moments have their origins in the forces acting on the ball (gravity and aerodynamic forces are considered) which, in the presence of relative motion between the ball and the projectile, lead to sliding friction torques. Torques due to fluid shear are also considered but these are found to be relatively insignificant. Exact solutions are obtained using standard numerical techniques. In addition, a linear form is developed and these solutions lead to useful approximations that are valid over a broad range of operating conditions.",,,,,,,,,,,,, 0|aRotational motion (Rigid dynamics); 0|aProjectiles|xTesting.,,,,"1 |aBloomer, James Wayne.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aUF750|b.N95|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768000444004,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Solution reports may require weeks to design, implement and produce with conventional report writing systems. The reports produced are voluminous, often exceeding 100,000 printed lines, and are thus quite awkward to access manually. Timely and economic analysis of solutions to large models is further hindered by inflexible and costly report writing software and procedures. ATHENA has been developed to allow extremely efficient immediate interactive storage and analysis of the solution file from any optimization system. ATHENA is easy to learn and use; user friendly features are provided which can preemptively assess the potential cost and implications of each request for solution information, assist the confused user, and provide the required solution information with very fast response time. The user is provided with extensive search under mask and compound logical relational constructs, as well as the capability to quickly diagnose suspicious model symptoms, and to format and issue offline reports. ATHENA is implemented in portable FORTRAN, with a parser and interpreter easily modified and expanded to suit particular hardware environments and user demands. The system has been initially designed and tuned for large-scale problems with up to 30,000 rows and columns. Live test demonstrations show that the system exhibits very fast response time in actual use.

The background of this analysis is the need for an improved assessment of the accuracy of through-flow computations. Traditional through-flow analyses are based on density weighted averaged quantities reducing to an area average in incomprehensible flows. On the other hand, experimental data are usually evaluated under the form of mass averagedd quantities, particularly with regard to the overall energy balance and efficiency estimations. The transition between these two sets of quantities is usually taken into account by introducing an averaged aerodynamic blockage factor in addition to the blade blockage factor resulting from the density averaged quantities. The present analysis provides a rigorous derivation for the momentum averaged flow components are necessary in order to justify the current practice of introduction of aerodynamics blockage. The recent avalibility of detailed flow data in single and two stage avial compressors allows a partial validation of these assumptions, by the comparison of the various non-axisymmetric components.

Counter-Cp3s activities are modeled as additional growth terms in uncertaintly that depend on the instantaneous knowledge of both sides.  It is shown for this model the relative shift of system equilibrium is directly proportional to the ratio of the counter-Cp3s coupling coefficient to the system's natural uncertainty (entropy) growth rate.  Furthermore, it is shown that small perturbations from the stable equilibrium are restored to equilibrium by the system forces, i.e. the sytem is ultrastable.  However, a perturbation of entropy of one side, induces a delayed perturbation of entropy on the other side with opposite sign.

ANAD is a highly important division of the United States Army  Materiel Command (AMC) and is the Army's designated Center of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE) for a  variety of combat vehicles, artillery equipment, bridging systems and small-caliber weapons. It provides advanced  maintenance support for all of these systems, in addition to fulfilling a host of other vitally important Army-wide  logistical functions. ANAD presently uses the Standard Depot System (SDS) to manage its complex array of  administrative and logistical functions. However, AMC has mandated that ANAD completely replace the SDS and  employ the new Logistics Modernization Program (LMP) starting in March 2009. The researchers gathered a  combination of historical information, personnel observations and responses to survey questionnaires on readiness for  change in order to conduct a quality analysis of ANAD structure and climate and their implications, if any, for LMP  implementation. Ultimately, people are the heart of any IT system, regardless of its size and degree of automation.  The tremendous importance of organizational personnel in the change process is often under appreciated and under  addressed in the civilian sector of the military-particularly when this sector embarks on significant IT transformation  initiatives. Bold IT actions inevitably have a profound impact on any organization, regardless of its size, mission, and  personnel composition.

The research literature indicates that a major barrier blocking progress in understanding ICC is the absence of reliable, valid measures for the construct.  This study addresses this problem.  It presents the results of ICC scale development using samples of public sector, defense and security professionals from two areas:  Homeland Defense and Security and Defense Acquisition and Contracting.  The research presents scales that have very good to excellent internal-consistency reliability and convergent validity.

We find that the majority of the services contracts awarded and administered conformed to our expectation.  For example, most service contracts are competitively bid, fixed-priced awards without any type of contract incentive. However, we found that the Air Force and Navy use different contracting approaches--specifically in the areas of organizational level of acquisition offices (regional versus installation), the use of project teams, leaders of the acquisition effort (program personnel versus contracting officers), and managers of the services requirement (program personnel, contracting officers, and customer organizations).

It is an extension of previous work that established that Transaction Cost Economics has promising explanatory power in terms of costs of major DoD acquisition programs.  The current work explores methods of measuring transaction costs as a first step in improving estimation methods by including explanatory variables that capture the coordination and motivation problems associated with a program.  The preliminary results indicate that it is possible to measure contractor Systems Engineering/Program Management (SEPM) costs as a proxy for transaction costs.  The ratio of SEPM to total costs was examined for two case studies (Javelin and ATACMS) for which ex-ante indicators of transaction costs had been assessed.  The results are consistent in that the program with ex-ante indicators that indicated higher transaction costs also had a significantly higher SEPM ratio.  Further research is required to better establish the relationship between transaction costs indicators and the quality of DoD cost estimates.,,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aAngelis, Diana.;1 |aDillard, John.;1 |aFranck, Chip.;1 |aMelese, Francois.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2008/NPS-AM-08-126.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The number of systems required to share  data and provide reliable information in weapons systems is growing. Many systems, systems-of-systems and families  of systems with different software architectures are acquired and often have difficulty operating together, which  causes delays, increases costs, and limits re-use. Intelligent adoption of SOA and OA may help solve integration and  reuse issues in current and future acquisition programs. The commercial market is successfully beginning to  implement SOA and OA in their processes and may provide examples of best practices that can be applied to the  Defense Acquisition System. The goal of this thesis is to explore the feasibility of implementing SOA and OA into  the Defense Acquisition System. Adoption of SOA and OA practices is not expected to completely alter the current  Defense Acquisition System; instead, it is intended to alleviate some of its constraints. This thesis will focus on  utilizing SOA and OA in IWS, how SOA and OA principles relate, and the effects they will have on the Defense  Acquisition System's organizations and processes.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aWeapons systems.; 0|aCost.,,,,"1 |aBrummett, Cory S.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2008/NPS-AM-08-024.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The increasing emphasis on joint service and system-of-systems (SoS) capabilities has created both opportunities and challenges for materiel acquisition.  A key barrier that needs to be overcome for the DoD to achieve the promises of joint service and SoS programs involves the challenge of ""transaction costs.""  These are the less visible, but nonetheless significant, costs of negotiating, managing and monitoring transactions.  In an effort to identify the effect of transaction costs on more complex acquisition programs, this paper examines  cost and schedule breaches in a subset of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) that includes a sample of 84 programs, divided into ""joint service"" and ""traditional"" (single service) acquisition programs, and ""single system"" and ""system-of-systems"" (SoS) programs. The results suggest there is a statistically significant higher risk of cost and schedule breaches in SoS programs than in single system acquisition programs.

The LW need was approved in 1993. The requirement was to provide improvements for dismounted soldiers  in the five specific capability categories of lethality, command and control, mobility, survivability, and  sustainment. For a period lasting approximately 15 years, the LW has evolved. Despite this evolution, the  Army in FY 2007 terminated it in FY 2007. Regardless, it has laid the foundation for follow-on soldier system  initiatives. The LW was unsuccessful initially due to the misalignment of three interrelated and supporting  components; 1) technical immaturity, 2) poor user acceptance, and 3) lack of senior leadership support.

Under the enabling civil authority phase of  Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the Commanding General of the Joint Contracting  Command-Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A) pioneered effects-based contracting (EBC) to  align tactical contracting efforts with the strategic objectives of the OIF campaign  plan. The JCC-I/A accomplished this by integrating contingency contracting officers  (CCOs) with the warfighters' operational planning cycles, linking contracting efforts  with desired strategic operational effects, and prioritizing contracting work based on  the warfighters' main efforts.  This project applies EBC methodologies and the systems engineering  process to introduce the framework for the Joint Effects-based Contracting  Execution System (JEBCES)--an integrated composite of people, products, and  processes to deliver an acquisition capability. Within this framework, the  researchers propose a Phase-based Acquisition Capability (PBAC) to enable  forward-leaning, responsive joint expeditionary contract support.

Among other things, defense industrial affairs are becoming  increasingly global and increasingly complex.  In this discussion, we focus more on defense firms--considering the  organization of Boeing 787 development and production, the KC-45 aerial tanker  competition, and European defense firms' direct investment in the US defense  market. In the 787 case, we observe that even experienced companies such as  Boeing can run afoul of the complexities of coordinating a multiform venture.  The KC-45, at least so far, seems to illustrate a new weakness of defense  establishments relative to their suppliers. It is reasonable to suppose the two rival  bidders (NG-EADS and Boeing) will continue to have veto powers over source  selection--absent some fresh thinking.  European defense firms' (BAE, EADS and Finmeccanica) entry into the US  defense market through various direct investment strategies results from an  increasingly globalized defense market. More importantly, perhaps, it demonstrates  their ability to work around obstacles posed by US legislative and regulatory barriers.

To better understand DOD's technology adoption challenges, we review the technology diffusion literature to identify factors associated with successful and unsuccessful technology adoption processes, conduct case studies of DoD's advanced technology programs and propose a conceptual technology adoption model.  The literature review identifies three overarching factors reflecting the complexities of defense technology adoption: benefit-cost uncertainty, organizational externalities, and direct and indirect network externalities.  Technology adoption clearly involves benefit and cost uncertainties.  Organizational externalities arise because there are typically multiple stakeholders from different DoD constituencies.  Direct and indirect network externalities reflect the joint and interrelated nature of defense technologies on the battlefield. A closer look at one of DoD's advanced technology development programs indicates that success factors in this program  generally parallel the results of the literature survey: the importance of benefit-cost uncertainty, management commitment (organizational externalities), technology champion (network externalities) and the prospects for future technology transfer (network externalities). Finally, we present conceptual technology adoption models incorporating benefit-cost uncertainty, organizational externalities and network externalities.

In analyzing the defense market, we essay multiple analytical frameworks  (along the lines of Essence of Decision). Our analytical models are (a) a  sophisticated view of offsets in a public policy context with market imperfections, (b)  transaction cost economics with our unit of analysis being the nation-state instead of  the firm, and (c) two standard corporate strategy models.  To test the models' explanatory powers, we consider three ongoing ""cases"":  F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the UK Defence Industrial Strategy, and the Northrop  Grumman-EADS KC-30 proposal.

Most of these systems tend to be stand-alone systems which are focused on a relatively narrow set of analytical techniques for solving quite specific problems.  Many applications, however, require a combination of these technologies to address complex decision-making problems.  What is missing in the DSS landscape is an environment in which to create a DSS Generator that integrates requisite technologies flexibly and quickly to construct a robust application.  We discuss the notion of an integrated decision technology environment (IDTE) in the context of Federal acquisition and contracting.  Specifically, we show how the application of existing decision support technologies can assist Federal Government contracting personnel in determining which vendor proposal offers the best overall value to the customer in competitive solicitations.  The intent is to establish a model that, when implemented, will ensure that contracting personnel evaluate proposals both consistently and fairly for simplified acquisition procedures (SAP).  The proposed system, Source Selection Support System (S4), integrates several decision support technologies including a weight-based ranking model, a multi-criteria decision analysis software system, an expert system, data mining, and a data warehouse.  We describe the data, model, knowledge, and user interface components of S4, present a use case, and show how virtualization technology can facilitate the implementation of this DSS.

The parameter density measures how tightly systems and equipment are  placed within a hull structure. To address design characteristics unique to submarines, this research focuses mainly  on submarine design and procurement--lthough the general concepts are applicable to surface ship designs and may  be applied more broadly. Based on an examination of density as it relates to cost, this research indicates that: (1) the  use of weight-reduction policies as a means to reduce cost have often generated the opposite effect; (2) increased cost,  schedule and performance risk and an improper mix of design capability and flexibility are the inevitable outcomes of  unnecessarily dense designs; and (3) Arc-permeability and Internal Density, measures developed for this research, are  sufficient approximations of how tightly systems and equipment are placed within a compartment. Indeed, they may  reveal how density represents a significant and previously underemphasized, if not unexplained, driver of historic  submarine cost-growth in excess of inflation.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aCost control.; 0|aExperimental design.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2008/NPS-AM-08-115.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The research describes DoD's experience  with acquisition auctions, identifying the characteristics of the buyers, sellers, and  the products/services exchanged through auctions. In general, reverse auctions  have been limited to procurement actions involving relatively standard price-driven  commercial products--products typically purchased through traditional competitive  markets. It appears that DoD has substituted reverse auctions for the market  research required in the standard DoD procurement processes; the auction service  providers are replacing federal procurement agents in advertising the procurement  action and soliciting bids from competing suppliers.  Drawing on this background, this research examines auction mechanism(s)  that appear appropriate for the defense acquisition environment. Two specific  auction designs are explored. The first is a two-stage Iterated Information  Aggregation Auction (Ip2sAp2s) involving multiple product characteristics--including  price--that are specified as part of the auction bidding process. In the Ip2sAp2s, the first  stage acts as market research for gathering information dispersed across the  decentralized contractor base to establish characteristic weights to evaluate  proposals in the second stage. The research showed significant potential  performance improvements when decentralized trade-off information is centralized  through the Ip2sAp2s mechanism.  The second auction mechanism involves situations where the quality of fit  between the buyer and seller affect the transaction's value (e.g., synergy between  an author and an editor, etc.). This analysis explores the impact of asymmetric  information on the mechanism's design. The research developed optimal  mechanisms for transactions where both parties know the quality of fit and  transactions in which only one party (the buyer or sellers)",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aGates, William.;1 |aLamping, Jennifer.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2008/NPS-AM-08-013.pdf,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

PEO IWS is seeking ways to improve and mature the capability provided by SHARE.  To that end, a research project at the Naval Postgraduate School will produce a component specification and ontology framework for use in SHARE.  The framework will expand the information contained in the current metadata, to enable improved search and discovery capabilities and facilitate use of the repository items once they are retrieved.  This paper lays the foundation for the research, by providing a characterization of the problem domain by describing the SHARE repository, its contents and its unique attributes.  Based on this investigation, we then provide specific recommendations for both near term and long term improvements.  The near term suggestions are essentially ""low hanging fruit"", or ideas for quick improvements that can be implemented in a relatively short time frame.  The long term improvements are associated with the implementation of the component specification and ontology.

This paper explores the causes of the wave of defense mergers, as well as their impact. The analysis finds that the frequency of defense mergers is more strongly correlated with overall merger activity in the economy than with DoD outlays. In examining SAR cost data on weapons systems, only 54-64% of the weapons systems' costs were affected following consolidation activity by the primary contractor that made them, of which 39-43% of the systems experienced a statistically significant decrease in their costs, and 14-21% experienced a statistically significant increase. Despite a 2/3 reduction in the number of prime contractors in the fixed wing aircraft sector between 1990 and 1998, about 43% of the systems experienced a statistically significantly lower cost estimate. For the tactical missile category, in which the number of prime contractors also fell by 2/3, 14.3% of the systems indicated statistically significantly higher post-merger estimates and 28.6% of them indicated statistically significantly lower post-merger estimates. Boeing, Lockheed, and Raytheon were among the few main primary contractors in several sectors following the consolidation wave. About 60% of the weapons systems examined in this analysis which were produced by them indicated a statistically significant change in their cost estimates. For Boeing and Lockheed, 50% of the systems exhibited a statistically significant reduction in cost estimates, while, for Raytheon, 40% of the systems experienced a significant cost increase. About 2/3 of the systems made by Lockheed and Martin Marietta manifested significant cost declines following the Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger, and about 1/2 of the systems made by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas experienced a statistically significant decline in cost estimates following the merger. This suggests that, although market concentration levels may have increased in certain sectors, DoD's costs often tended to be lower in the post-merger period for certain weapons systems.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2007/NPS-AM-07-106.pdf,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Its basis is that in Integrated Warfare Systems (IWS) acquisition, 80% of total lifecycle costs occur during the Operation and Support phase.  This statistic demonstrates the necessity of measuring how the OA approach will affect software upgrades and maintenance processes for the AEGIS IWS lifecycle. Using the OA approach, advances in distance support and monitoring and maintenance-free operating periods are possible; these advances are significant in supporting the need to reduce costs and manpower while improving performance. To estimate the potential (Return on Investment) ROI that an OA approach might enable SE in the form of software maintenance and upgrades,  this thesis will apply the Knowledge Value Added (KVA) methodology to establish the baseline, ""As Is,"" configuration of the current solutions in AEGIS. The KVA analysis will yield the ROI's and the current models for the approach to software maintenance and upgrades. Based on the assumptions of OA design for original system development, new approaches to distance and maintenance and monitoring will be explored in ""To Be"" solutions, and the ROIs will be estimated. The ""To Be"" solutions are rooted in the assumptions of MFOP and ARCI, and the results indicate that these solutions yield a potential improvement of 720% and a cost savings of $3 65,104.63 over the current methodology for just one ship. For all ships using AEGIS, ROI improves by 71,967%--with a cost savings of $2 6,543,824.56. The conclusion is that OA enables extension of these best practice approaches to AEGIS maintenance and upgrade solutions.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aAhart, Jennifer L.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2007/NPS-AM-07-049.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The DoD policy for evolutionary acquisition mandates multiple product releases via spiral (i.e., amorphous & unplanned) or incremental (i.e., defined & deferred) development methodologies for all programs. All amorphous spirals eventually become definitive increments. Incremental development entails the deliberate deferral of work to a subsequent phase. Computational organizational modeling using systems dynamics reveals that this methodology introduces more concurrency during development, and more variety in production. The result is earlier delivery of the first increment, but with later and more costly delivery of subsequent increments than if conducted via a single-step methodology. Curtailments of scope by the exclusive use of mature technology enable more effective delivery of the first increment, further illustrated by two case studies. Duplication, rework, transaction costs, decision backlog and error are causes of inefficiency in the successive increments. Production variety and mixed configurations produce obvious implications for logistical supportability, training, failure causality, compatibility and interoperability, etc. Further, certain attributes of hardware products might help determine the suitability of this development methodology. Products that are nearly immutable, which have binary requirements for key capabilities, require man-rating, or are maintenance-intensive may not be good candidates for incremental development. Mutable products with costless production, continuous requirements, low maintenance, or time criticality are more likely to reap advantages from this development approach. While modular open systems architecture facilitates system adaptation, modularity itself does not necessarily create evolutionary advantages, due to relative modular interdependency. Program managers must be aware of the inherent risks of these agile acquisition methods and take additional steps to balance them with appropriate planning and resources, disciplined change-control measures, organizational accommodations and accountability for configuration management.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aFord, David N.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2007/NPS-AM-07-002.pdf,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The hope is that these suppliers would compete on price, transactions would be automated and low cost, and as a result, the price of goods and services would fall. Numerous Internet marketplaces came into being during the Internet boom; however, an almost equal number disappeared following the Internet bubble burst. Still, many survive today based on a variety of models that are quite successful. If a right model is selected, it could help large organizations, like the DoD, achieve great efficiencies for their acquisition and procurement processes.  The objective of the paper is to examine models for classifying and differentiating the business functionality provided by Internet marketplaces and to investigate the impact of the various models on government and DoD acquisition. The models will consider such variables as types of goods and services purchased, how these goods and services are purchased, pricing mechanisms, the characteristics of the markets, and ownership of marketplace",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,10|aUnited States.|bDept. of Defense.,,, 0|aAutomation.; 0|aElectronic commerce.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2007/NPS-AM-07-048.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This project was conducted with the sponsorship and assistance of the Naval Postgraduate School's Acquisition Research Program, Financial Management and International programs. The overall goal of this project is three-fold: 1) To identify the purpose of the United States FMS program and its processes 2) To identify, define and evaluate historical economic, political, social and industrial changes and trends that affect FMS worldwide allocation and support and 3) To apply these findings to a specific country (Taiwan) to make a prediction of future participation and support. The role of arms sales in world politics has grown tremendously since the end of World War II and more specifically since the passage of new arms laws in 1979.  The importance of FMS is increasingly evident in the foreign policies of both supplier and recipient nations, in international politics, competition and relations. Arms sales have become in recent years a crucial dimension of international affairs. This paper examines several trends in military equipment, services and training exchanges and investigates their potential impact on the future conflicts. The nature of FMS is complex. This research plans to identify and analyze trends relating to sociopolitical, economic, and industrial and technological changes associated with FMS spending. This discussion then applies these findings to Taiwan as a case study and expands on the customer's experience with FMS. The intent of this paper is to increase the reader's knowledge of FMS, pinpoint trends in the program and use FMS to Taiwan as a point of comparison to increase comprehension of this extremely complex and not well-understood program.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aHo, Chih-Haur.;1 |aFoust, Coleen A.;1 |aKerutis, Aidas.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2007/NPS-AM-07-045.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Between FY 1999 to FY 2003, DoD's spending on services increased by 66%, and in FY 2003, the DoD spent over $118 billion (or approximately 57% of total DoD procurement dollars) on services.  In recent years, the DoD has spent more on services than on supplies, equipment and goods, even considering the high value of weapon systems and large military items.  These services belong to a very broad set of activities, ranging from grounds maintenance to space launch operations.  The major categories include professional, administrative, and management support; construction, repair, and maintenance of facilities and equipment; information technology; research and development, and medical care. As the DoD's services acquisition volume continues to increase in scope and dollars, the agency must pay greater attention to proper acquisition planning, adequate requirements definition, sufficient price evaluation, and proper contractor oversight.  In many ways, these are the same issues affecting the acquisition of physical supplies and weapon systems.  However, the unique characteristics of services and the increasing importance of services acquisition offer a significant opportunity for conducting research in the management of the service supply chain in the Department of Defense. The objectives of the exploratory research presented in the paper are to (1) analyze the size, structure and trends in the DoD's service supply chain, (2) understand the challenges faced by contracting officers, program managers and end-users in services acquisition, (3) develop a conceptual framework for understanding and analyzing the supply chain in services, and (4) provide policy recommendations that can lead to more effective and efficient management of the DoD's spending on services.  In addition to the analysis of service acquisition-related data and theory development, this research also includes empirical work in terms of site visits and interviews at Navy, Army and Air Force bases.

These are contrasted with their evaluation of the actual emphasis they found to be placed on Navy, career, and personal needs, their degree of involvement in the decision process, and the acceptability of the new assignment. Multivariate analyses determined the contribution of these factors to overall satisfaction with the detailing process and their impact on career intentions. The majority of officers were satisfied with detailing and their new assignment and intended to continue on active duty. Both the minority that was less than satisfied and those on whom the detailing process made a negative career impact were in sufficient numbers to warrant further efforts to study and improve the handling of midcareer officer moves.

This resulted in a critical need to improve acoustic sensing systems to better recognize foreign submarines.  Although new capability was critically needed, required resources were not available to support the developmental effort.  Critical need and the absence of sufficient funding constituted a crisis--demanding a revolutionary approach to achieve necessary technological improvement. The approach came to be called A-RCI--Acoustic Rapid COTS Insertion, which might be characterized in the following manner.  A-RCI used modular open-system architecture (MOSA).  Hardware and software would progress on different paths and timelines.  Key interfaces, standards, and protocols would be rigorously controlled as necessary to insure that different modules would work together.  Commercial Off-the-shelf (COTS) purchases would be encouraged, and software reuse would be accomplished where feasible.  Innovative solutions would be sought from a deliberately broadened array of participants, including defense contractors, Government labs, academia, and small business.  Technical performance would be demonstrated by testing against known real-world performance standards.  Technical decisions would be validated by peer review. The A-RCI approach demanded a new way of doing business.  Technical approaches must compete on a level playing field.  Contractual mechanisms must be established to address not only competition, but also cooperation among winning competitors once the selections were made.  Intellectual property rights and sharing of information must be carefully structured to achieve fairness as well as practicality.  Rapid improvement must be brought to fielding via demanding schedules.  The Navy's relationship with the prime contractor must change dramatically.  The submarine user community must be intimately involved. A-RCI took an integrated acoustic system that was difficult and time consuming to change and converted it into a federated system that could be upgraded in modules--""Plug and Play.""  Such an approach was common in the private sector in the 1990s and even before.  Although the idea wasn't new, the application of this approach to a warfighting system was daunting.  As a point of reference, in the mid-1990s, IBM was struggling with the similar arguments about changing the way they did business; that is, should IBM stick with mainframe computers running proprietary programs, or should the company pursue the integration of ""best of breed"" software solutions that could interoperate with competitors' software and run on computers manufactured by competitors of IBM?  Even today, there are arguments within DoD about whether federated systems are a sound approach.  Acoustic Rapids COTS Insertion progressed at a seemingly crushing pace, with software changes being implemented annually and hardware changes biannually.  A-RCI was a ""poster child"" for evolutionary acquisition, because the endpoint of the effort was not clearly defined, even though there was a recognized need for improvement. The results of A-RCI were astounding cost reduction, dramatic improvement in technical performance, successful use of COTS hardware in a critical warfighting application, logistics support improvements, and an acquisition model that might have broad applicability across the DoD. Together with A-RCI's amazing results came a series of questions that must be considered.  Was A-RCI a one-time success, providing a model that could not be re-applied because of structural impediments within DoD?  Was A-RCI leadership a unique alignment of extraordinary people that brought about change, but is unlikely to be duplicated for future systems?  Is DoD's acquisition culture so rigid that it will stifle and kill future similar efforts?  Will cooperation among the user community support similar efforts in the future?  Are there such operational demands on the user community that members cannot tolerate the tempo of change that delivers new software or hardware technology annually or bi-annually?  Is modular open-systems architecture scaleable to large warfighting systems: fire control or command and control systems, for example?

Accurate and timely information will enable Joint Vision 2020 key tenets: Dominant Maneuver, Precision Engagement, Focused Logistics, and Full Dimensional Protection.  These networks are central warfighting platforms in the information age.  As these capabilities are developed over time in an evolutionary manner, interoperability on the Net-Centric Warfare (NCW) networks is essential, and both hardware and software systems must be designed in an Open-systems Architecture (OA) fashion to accommodate the vast number of changes anticipated.  Professional Program Management will be needed to successfully develop these key warfighting platforms.  Materiel Developers will need to recognize the relatively immature nature of the software engineering domains and actively compensate for this immaturity.  System software performance capabilities must be much more detailed than typical hardware-centric systems, as the current state of software engineering disciplines is unlikely to satisfy implied, yet critical performance requirements.

One reason is that the public perceives that the government too rigidly enforces laws and regulations or that favoritism or bias influences decisions to make exceptions or waivers of rules.  Although observed in various contexts, such perception is particularly evident in government contracting and procurement.  This perception can erode the public confidence in government; thus, improving the public's perception is paramount.  An approach to this perception problem involves instilling objectivity in a government decision to make an exception or ""waiver"" of a procurement rule or regulation.  Analytical techniques can be used to evaluate the decision of whether or not to waive a particular procurement rule or regulation.  Granted, a waiver may be unnecessary in exigent circumstances (where life or health is in imminent danger) because procurements under such exigent circumstances are often exempt from application of procurement rules.  Yet, absent such exigent circumstances, a waiver of a particular regulation may require a formal exception by an administrative body, an executive, a court-issued injunction, or even legislation.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aPolitical science|xDecision making.; 0|aContracting and procurement|zUnited States|xGovernment.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aThird Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2006/NPS-AM-06-067.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The changes have created a more business-to-business like contracting methodology, via commercial item designation streamlined procedures, for the conduct of Federal procurements meeting specific criteria defined in statutory authority provided under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA), and the Services Acquisition Reform Act (SARA).   The aforementioned legislation allows for the utilization of Simplified Acquisition Procedures for all commercial item designated goods and services up to and including $5 million.  The legislation was passed in order to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal contracting processes.   However, based on informal review of the business decision protocol at many acquisition and contracting centers, and as a result of similar research conducted in the Fall of 2004, contracting activities may not be effectively utilizing the legislative authority to garner efficiencies and effective service provision that may be possible under the new legislation.   Objective:  The objective is to determine the extent to which DoD activities are capitalizing on the legislative provisions of FARA, FASA, and SARA, and to make specific recommendations for improving the full utilization of the commercial item designation provisions.  This objective is critical to contracting and acquisition commands (as well as those they support) to achieve reduced acquisition lead times, reduce transactional costs, and generally, garner efficiencies and effectiveness not possible without the legislative provisions.  The research would:  1) provide an overview of the legislation; 2) investigate current business practices within DoD related to the legislative provisions; 3) analyze and determine the extent to which DoD is capitalizing on the provisions, and; 4) make specific recommendations for better utilizing the legislation to the benefit of DoD.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aThird Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2006/NPS-AM-06-066.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Building upon prior, multidisciplinary research, we draw upon the best knowledge and practice in change management, and analyze transformation from the classic Hierarchy to the Edge-like Holonistic organization, which offers excellent potential for performance improvement. Such analysis focuses on the processes of change from one organizational form to another and leads to the generation of transformational plans, which can be used by acquisition leaders, practitioners and policy makers to outline steps--and leaps--required to affect fundamental organizational change. We also build upon prior work on computational modeling and experimentation to develop models of the transformation process, and we explore such models to emulate the behavior of the alternate transformational plans noted above. By modeling and experimenting with processes of change, as opposed to processes of ongoing organizational routines, we begin to extend the state-of-the-art in computational modeling and experimentation.

To shed light on this problem, this paper introduces the notion of ""Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence"" as the ability of groups to effectively leverage the IT functionalities of collaborative IT tools to facilitate their group activities. Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence is conceptualized as a formative second-order construct formed by the group's effective use of the following six key IT functionalities: workspace sharing, conferencing, file sharing, scheduling, chat, and email. Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence is hypothesized to facilitate group performance (process efficiency, project effectiveness, and situational awareness), particularly in intense work environments. To enhance a group's ability to effectively leverage collaborative IT tools, the study proposes a set of enabling factors: customization of the collaborative IT tools, the group's habit in using collaborative IT tools, the group's perceived usefulness and ease of use of collaborative IT tools, the group member's mutual trust, and the degree of environmental intensity.  Data from 365 group managers support the proposed structural model with the antecedents and consequences of Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence at different levels of environmental intensity.

The literature review presents the theoretical framework surrounding the transformation of purchasing to supply management along with its major developments such as integrated supplier relationships, total ownership costs, cross-functional teams, supply chains, e-procurement systems, and strategic sourcing strategies.  Strategic sourcing and developing sourcing strategies are discussed and include the Kraljic model for determining the best type of procurement strategy for specific products or services.  Commodity sourcing strategies are discussed in conjunction with Lasseter's seven-step process for developing commodity sourcing strategies.  The application of strategic sourcing in the commercial sector is discussed using examples from industry, along with applications within the Department of Defense.  Some challenges to strategic sourcing identified in the report include access to the required spend data, highly fragmented supply base, and government procurement goals.  The report also identifies best practices such as establishing common processes and tools, using cross-functional teams, ensuring adequate team sponsorship and authority, and aggressively managing purchasing requirements.  The report concludes that strategic sourcing initiatives have resulted in significant cost reductions, increases in productivity, quality improvement, and return on investment.  The DoD's strategic sourcing initiatives have also resulted in significant savings, albeit with some obstacles and barriers yet to overcome.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aArmed Forces|xProcurement.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aSecond Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.org/_files/FY2005/NPS-AM-05-047.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This PMM includes multiple performance measures relevant to its distribution channel for products, repair parts and maintenance services. The PMM is intended to reflect the company's understanding of performance relations among strategic resources, operational capabilities, and desired financial outcomes. The PMM also reflects its intended distribution strategy, the types of performance necessary to achieve that strategy by its distributors, and its desired financial outcomes.  Furthermore, the company uses the model to evaluate its North American distributors and intends to use these evaluations as a partial basis for annual and long-term rewards. Thus, the PMM embodies the measurable portion of the firm's management control system of its distribution channel. The study addresses four research questions: (1) Are measure attributes important considerations for performance measure choice? (2) Does the importance of attributes differ according to firm strategy?  (3) Does the importance of attributes for design and use differ according to firm strategy?  (4) Does a company trade-off some individual attributes for others?  The questions are investigated using qualitative and quantitative analyses of archival documents and interviews with top managers and distributors.  Principal findings are that measure attributes are important considerations for choice and change of performance measures; design attributes are more important than use attributes; the importance of attributes does not appear to differ according to strategy; and some individual attributes are traded-off for other attributes.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aSelto, Frank H.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aSecond Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.org/_files/FY2005/NPS-AM-05-041.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

By analyzing the sub-elements of both operational effectiveness and operational suitability it can be shown how operational effectiveness is a dependent element of operation suitability.  Additionally, it will be demonstrated how support costs influence operational suitability parameters of a weapon system, which then impacts a combat unit's overall mission effectiveness.  Since support costs have such a critical relationship with operational suitability factors, the project also defines the current relationships between Service Cost and T&E communities to question whether or not there is the requisite level of integration of effort between the two organizations to accurately assess weapon system costs and capability prior to production.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aFirst Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2004/NPS-AM-04-022.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Because this research is exploratory, it focuses on only one initiative:  the 2002 initiative ""Focus on results, not process.""  A qualitative method approach was used to suggest a four part framework.  Through the review of literature, common steps for creating metrics were established and recurrent characteristics of good metrics were identified.  Then interviews were conducted with acquisition practitioners who have experience with the initiative.  Finally, those three parts were applied to the initiative as a case study and metrics suggested as a result.  This study gives Air Force leaders clear, implementable metrics that can be used as measures of success for the initiative, and provides recommendations to improve this initiative's performance and that of future corporate Air Force acquisition initiatives.  This study also gives leaders insight into whether or not this initiative and others like it are an appropriate and effective way to drive the changes they are meant to bring about.

Determining the value added by management becomes particularly important as Navy acquisition managers deal with increasingly complex, open business models that engage many more participants in the development and implementation of products and services to support warfighters. There is a recognition that emerging, increasingly complex acquisition environments require more direction, collaboration, and control to achieve the reductions in costs as well as the increases in warfighting effectiveness that initiatives, such as the Open Architecture (OA) system acquisition and development framework, promise.

However, the projected personnel requirements for the three principal components of the LCS deployment profile, i.e., the ship's crew, the aviation detachment and the Focused Mission Package detachment, combine for a significantly higher number.  An in-depth analysis of collected data and information indicates that employing contractor personnel to conduct or support combat missions on board LCS or any other Navy combatant is impracticable and contrary to the international laws of armed conflict.

Acquisition reform initiatives have fundamentally transformed the protocols and processes the Federal Government utilizes to procure billions of dollars' worth of goods and services every year.  Reforms provided under the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA), the Federal Acquisition Reform Act (FARA), and the Services Acquisition Reform Act (SARA), along with ensuing regulatory provisions in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), have created a more business-to-business-like contracting methodology.  One such methodology is the FAR 13.5 Test Program for Commercial Items.  FAR 13.5 allows the utilization of Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) for all commercial-item designated goods and services up to and including $5.5 million. The FAR 13.5 provisions are aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal contracting processes. The FAR 13.5 regulatory provision has tremendous potential to alleviate field contracting activities' work-in-process backlogs, improve cycle-time, reduce transaction costs, and increase customer satisfaction in the business processes designed to provide essential goods and services.  However, based on the researcher's review of the business decision protocol at many acquisition and contracting centers, and as a result of similar research conducted in 2004,  2005 and 2006, this text asserts many contracting activities may not be effectively utilizing the legislative and regulatory authority under FAR 13.5 to garner desired efficiencies and effectiveness. Therefore, the objective of this research study is to determine the extent to which the Navy's FISC (Fleet and Industrial Supply Center) activities are capitalizing on the legislative provisions and regulatory provisions of FAR 13.5 and to make specific recommendations for improving the full utilization of the FAR 13.5 commercial-item designation provisions. This sponsored research study:  1) provides an overview of the applicable legislative and regulatory provisions, specifically FAR 13.5, and urges full utilization of the FAR 13.5 provisions, 2) investigates current business practices within the Fleet and Industrial Supply Centers (FISC) related to the FAR 13.5 regulatory provisions, 3) determines the extent to which FISC is reporting FAR 13.5 utilization and the degree of effective and efficient utilization of the FAR 13.5 provision, and 4) provides research conclusions and specific recommendations for better utilization of the FAR 13.5 provisions designed to benefit all process-protocol stakeholders, including the FISCs, their supported customers, the Navy and, ultimately, the American taxpayers.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.org/_files/FY2006/NPS-AM-06-049.pdf,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This was less of a problem when single vendors managed the entire acquisition life cycle. To take advantage of the potential of OA to use common off the shelf software modules, multiple vendors, greater access and involvement of the acquisition professional and future users of the IWS, collaborative information technology is a necessary ingredient. And, to make collaborative tools useful in the IWS acquisition life cycle, users must leverage their competence with the collaborative tools. To shed light on this requirement, this paper introduces the construct of 'Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence' as the ability of various OA work groups involved in the IWS acquisition life cycle to effectively leverage collaborative IT tools to enhance their group performance. Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence is conceptualized as a second-order construct formed by the group's effective use of the following six key IT functionalities: workspace sharing, conferencing, file sharing, scheduling, chat, and email. Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence is hypothesized to facilitate group performance (process efficiency, project effectiveness, and situational awareness), particularly in intense work environments such as OA acquisition contexts. To enhance an OA work group's ability to effectively leverage collaborative IT tools, the study proposes a set of enabling factors: customization of the collaborative IT tools, group habits in using collaborative IT tools, the group's perceived usefulness and ease of use of collaborative IT tools, the group member's mutual trust, and the degree of environmental intensity.  Data from 365 group managers support the proposed structural model with the antecedents and consequences of Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence at different levels of environmental intensity. The paper discusses the study's contributions of better understanding the nature, antecedents, and consequences of Collaborative IT Tools Leveraging Competence on OA work group performance.

Third party financing of capital improvements through PPPs has resulted in reduced energy consumption and savings to tax-payers.  For example, to modernize existing facilities, the government has used private corporations, such as Hannon-Armstrong, LLC, to overcome shortfalls in appropriated funds.  Third party financing and ESPCs present viable solutions to modernizing and reducing the energy consumption of the government's mobile assets.  The first part of this research examines Hannon Armstrong's ""fee for service contract"" solution to funding the vital fiber-optic link near the Arctic Circle.   The second part explores the history of the Energy Saving Performance Contracts (ESPCs), which have helped reduce energy consumption throughout the federal government. Historically, this program has only been used for fixed assets.  There is little debate over the success of these contracts in reducing energy consumption.

The CRUDES fleet would immediately benefit by the removal of Captain's gigs/second RHIB in favor of a unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in order to increase warfighting capabilities. An analysis of N86 CRUDES ROC/POEs revealed no impact to primary or secondary warfighting missions by removing the gig/second RHIB. In today's capabilities-based warfighting, this replacement better supports the global concept of operations. The research was limited to sparsely deployed platforms, developmental project results, and test procedures as delineated in various UV concepts of operations. It was found that the preponderance of UVs remain largely experimental and not integrated into organizational Navy (SMD/FMD) or Marine Corps (TO&E) manpower management documents. The research found that unmanned vehicles are actually part of larger UV systems (which require human operators) and that simply adding UVs does not result in manpower cost savings. Some advantages of UVs are persistent on station time and removal of the human operator from potentially harmful and fatiguing environments. Research indicates that, though still in their infancy, Navy UV's are being employed by naval personnel but closely supported by contractors while operating on Naval platforms and in Naval units. Additionally, the majority of existing UV tactics and training address ISR and undersea missions with no definitive operational doctrine for unmanned combat vehicles (UCV). The report includes an UV acronym list (Appendix B) extracted from publications (Appendix C), a notional launch-and-recovery procedure and a notional estimate of USV manpower requirements and watch organization. Significant consideration must be made in the design and acquisition process as to who will operate these systems. The responsibility and spatial acumen required to operate UVs must be delineated prior to the acquisition phase so as to include key performance parameters (KPP) in unmanned vehicle design. An UV's size, tier of operational employment and payload play a critical role in determining level of operator autonomy, responsibility (i.e., paygrade) and supervision.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,," 0|aVehicles, Remotely piloted.; 0|aDrone aircraft.; 0|aRemote submersibles.",,,,"1 |aMiller, Gregory.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy.

Decision reviews are typically used as top management level control gates, and are also a feature of centralized control within a bureaucracy.  Although the current stated policy is to foster an environment supporting flexibility and innovation, the new framework will cause Program Managers to devote more time and other resources managing the decision bureaucracy.  Moreover, the implicit aspects of the still new model have not been fully realized, and may result in policy that actually lengthens programs and delivers yesterday's technology tomorrow -- counter to goals of rapid transformation.

History has recorded, however, the very clear and significant contributions of his Bureau's work--particularly its research agend--to the formation of the field of American Public Administration.  Thus, while Allen certainly perceived the potential contributions of administrative research, it's highly doubtful he could have imagined the development and maturation over the next century of this entirely new field of study in the US. Public Administration today includes hundreds of graduate degree programs, dozens of academic journals and conferences, and thousands of scholars. The objects of its study have expanded from municipal administration to include federal, state, international, and, more recently, not-for-profit administration. Today, we issue a call for ""1,000 scholars for defense acquisition research."" As Allen believed in the possibilities for municipal research, we also believe in the possibilities for melioration of acquisition's seemingly intractable problems through systematic study. While Allen saw the skills of accountants as sufficient for the tasks he had in mind, we instead call for a truly interdisciplinary mix of scholars suitable for engaging the diverse facets of acquisition's many technical, managerial, and political issues. Obviously, such an ambitious call cannot be answered by a single or even a dozen institutions. Accordingly, the NPS Acquisition Research Program has among its principal objectives the cultivation of an interdisciplinary community of acquisition scholars from many institutions around the world. This Symposium is merely a single step toward achieving that objective. Other recent steps include new research partnerships that NPS has forged with several other universities and the new International Journal of Defense Acquisition Management (http://www.acquisitionjournal.org), a scholarly journal jointly published and supported by the Acquisition Research Program and Cranfield University at the Defence College of Management of Technology.  From our limited perspective, such steps may seem woefully inadequate for the task of achieving meaningful and lasting acquisition reform.

Faculty are ""refreshed"" in defense-relevant subject matter, and students are better prepared to enter the acquisition work force.  In recognition of these successes, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) provided $1M in funding for additional projects.  This funding expands the ARP by 30% and is a pilot for future increases in research funding.  Researcher opportunities provided by the Chair offer significant benefits to researchers: (1) provision of funding saving researchers ""marketing"" time; (2) ties with sponsor POCs thus assuring DOD relevant research; (3) assistance with final formatting, editing and publishing thus relieving researchers from the ""non-intellectual"" aspects of their research.  Each of these is a substantial benefit but the growing connectivity between researchers and sponsors is paying large dividends to all concerned.  While we at the Naval Postgraduate School like to think of our institution as the world's leader in defense acquisition research, we also recognize that, because of our limited size and resources, we are able to study only a few of acquisition's myriad of complex issues and challenges.  We know that genuine progress in acquisition research can be achieved and sustained only to the extent that scholars from a broad range of institutions and disciplines are engaged to participate.  Once this ""critical mass"" of researchers is formed, we may anticipate that acquisition will become a field of its own, with perhaps a variety of acquisition journals, acquisition conferences, and university courses in acquisition management and policy.  Such intellectual capacity, we may hope, will before long prevail against acquisition's perennial and often pernicious problems. Accordingly, the year 2006 was especially significant for the NPS Acquisition Research Program in taking major strides toward expanding the program's reach in important ways to other institutions.  The number of research institutions participating as collaborators grew to 35 with the formation of a Virtual University Consortium.  Most noteworthy was, as mentioned above, our securing sponsorship from USD(AT&L) to fund research proposals selected from a nationwide call, or Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) (copy available at www.acquisitionresearch.org).  We're truly excited at the prospects of receiving innovative and cutting edge proposals from the top minds around the country.  We trust that this new sponsorship will act like good seeds sown in fertile soil, yielding rich fruits of profitable acquisition research for many years to come.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aFourth Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/Symposi/2007/NPS-AM-07-003.v.1.pdf|z(3.023 KB);40|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/Symposi/2007/NPS-AM-07-004.v.2.pdf|z(3.397 KB);40|zvol. 1|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2007/NPS-AM-07-003.pdf;40|z. vol. 2|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2007/NPS-AM-07-004.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This term is intended to highlight Acquisition's inherent complexity as an endeavor that entails a variety of challenges, including political, managerial, technological and--in the case of defense Acquisition--military challenges.  It also highlights the need for research from a variety of disciplines to be brought to bear in order to meet these challenges.   The NPS Acquisition Research Program's purposeful pursuit of ""big A Acquisition"" research is evident in these Proceedings.  Disciplines and fields of study which are represented include contract management, project management, logistics and supply chain management, systems engineering, economics, public management and policy, financial management, information systems, and organizational behavior.  While research in a few other disciplines (e.g., personnel management) has yet to be tapped, the engagement of such a wide range of approaches represents, in our view, significant progress. The past year marked ""the coming of age"" of the Acquisition Research Program.  By every measure, the program grew and matured.  The number of projects and products more than doubled over 2004 and faculty participation was up 50%.  Of special significance was the increased involvement of tenured track faculty, from eight to twenty-one, in acquisition research.  Much of this progress can be attributed to the increased stability of the program.  Funds were readily identifiable and available to allow faculty to count on them when formulating their work plans for the coming year.  A formalized research proposal and solicitation process was established by the Associate Dean of Research in the Graduate School of Business and Public Policy (GSBPP) which greatly enhanced communication about the program and encouraged participation.  It was apparent that interest in the program had spread throughout the faculty, and future program growth would be constrained only by financial resources. Similar remarks could be made about student involvement and participation. The program has also made a major contribution to maintaining the relevancy of faculty and instructional materials.  Significant benefits to researchers include: (1) provision of funding which saves researchers ""marketing"" time; (2) ties with sponsor POCs, thus assuring DoD-relevant research; (3) assistance with final formatting, editing and publishing, thus relieving researchers from the ""non-intellectual"" aspects of their research.  Each of these is a substantial benefit, but the growing connectivity between researchers and sponsors is paying large dividends to all concerned.  New, relevant instructional materials emerge out of almost all research products, and this has a positive impact on all students.  Sponsors receive substantial help and insight with the business issues of the day.

While we should never discount the significance of these measures, the view that the 1990s were the genesis of acquisition reform diminishes perspective of the long history of reform efforts linked to names such as Goldwater, Nichols, Grace, Carlucci, Packard, and Hoover, to name but a few.  Indeed, these efforts extend back in our history to the Continental Congress' attempts to reform the buying practices of General Washington's Army.  Considering this history, ""reform"" may well be acquisition's defining theme.  Of course, acquisition can never be truly and completely ""reformed.""  As a process, acquisition continually evolves as military and political priorities shift, as economic and business conditions change, and as technology advances.  Acquisition reform, then, must also be viewed as a process rather than as an end state.  The slogan of 16th century Protestants, Reformata et Semper Reformandum (""Reformed and Always Reforming""), must apply in acquisition. How may such a perspective take hold in acquisition?  Elected and appointed leaders can provide the political will to pursue reform, but reform cannot simply conform to shifting political landscapes.  Acquisition professionals have the expertise to implement reform measures, but as ""owners"" of acquisition processes they often have difficulty challenging the status quo. We assert that a process of continual reform must include acquisition researchers.  Only research can provide the type of critical and focused inquiry that informs acquisition's policies and practices and thus promotes its reform.  It is in such a spirit of reform that the Acquisition Research Program at the Naval Postgraduate School seeks to engage research in the study of acquisition and its important issues. The potential benefits of acquisition research are myriad.  It can contribute to the effective practice of acquisition in DoD through development of an expanded knowledge base about the field.  It can contribute to sound, scientifically-based proposals and recommendations for acquisition decision makers.  Perhaps most significantly, it can provide a solid theoretical grounding for future training and educational programs that will enable the workforce to think more creatively and critically about the key issues and challenges of acquisition.  In pursuit of such possibilities, we are pleased to publish these Proceedings of the Naval Postgraduate School's inaugural Acquisition Research Symposium held on Thursday, May 13, 2004, in Monterey, CA.  Titled ""Charting a Course for Change: Acquisition Theory and Practice for a Transforming Defense,"" the symposium served successfully, in our view, as a forum for the exchange of ideas among a distinguished and diverse body of scholars and practitioners of public sector acquisition.  The contents feature presentations on recently completed and on-going research projects conducted under the Acquisition Research Program, as well as an excellent keynote address by The Honorable Jacques S.

Our solution comprises an  emergency access control policy, an operational model and a scalable system security architecture. The operational model involves endusers who are on call as first responders, providers of critical information, and a coordinating authority. Extraordinary access to information is allowed to occur only during emergencies, and only in a confined emergency partition, which is unavailable before the  emergency and can be completely purged after the emergency. As all information remains within its assigned partition, after the emergency the system can meaningfully enforce its pre-emergency access control policy. A major component of the architecture is the end-user device, and we describe mechanisms on the device for secure storage of data, and for management of emergency state, to  indicate feasibility.",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aGrant numbers: CNS-0430566 and CNS-0430598.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 4/30/09,,,,, 0|aHardware.; 0|aDesign.,,,,"1 |aLevin, Timothy.;1 |aIrvine, Cynthia.;1 |aBenzel, Terry.;1 |aNguyäãen, Tháuy.;1 |aClark, Paul.;1 |aBhaskara, Ganesha.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aNational Science Board (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-CS-09-001.pdf|z(1.29 MB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Contingency Contracting operations are increasingly the major source of support and provisioning in forward theaters, especially in light of reductions in organic (non-contracted) support capabilities. Recently, theater combatant commanders have come to rely on contingency contracting officers to support coalition forces, and concurrently, to achieve a transformation of the economic landscape essential for achieving theater objectives.  But, critics of recent operations cite deficiencies in DoD's ability to effectively and efficiently conduct a coordinated contracting support effort that integrates the combatant commander's theater objectives with the myriad stakeholders deemed essential for success.  Can we, the military, achieve better results?  The author contends that with proper understanding of integrated planning and execution, contingency contracting operations can, and will, provide significant leverage for achieving the combatant commander's objectives.  The author formally presented, on August 7th, 2003, a Yoder three-tier model for contingency contracting operations to the faculty of the Naval Postgraduate School.  Subsequent to the NPS faculty presentation, the author published a synoptic ""interest"" article in the Army AL&T Magazine's January-February 2004 edition, entitled, ""Contingency Contracting Operations--Achieving Better Results."" Because of continued interest in the Yoder three-tier model expressed by academics, force planners, and contracting offices from several agencies, the author believes a more comprehensive write-up of the Yoder three-tier model is appropriate.  The NPS Acquisition Symposium provides the in-depth coverage, broad dissemination and recognized avenue for open dialogue of the model and its potential efficacy.  As such, this paper proposes the Yoder three-tier contingency contracting officer model structure for Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force support of theater contingency contracting operations.  The creation of this Yoder three-tier model and its employment will allow for better planning and coordination; likewise, it will allow for better tactical, operational, and theater objective support.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aSecond Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2005/NPS-CM-05-053.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Different agencies within Federal Government have lowered the dollar threshold to as little as $100,000 depending on the type of contract action.  Using PPI as a factor in all source selections was a tactic modeled after industry best practices.  The Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) envisioned that industry PPI collected by Federal agencies would eventually be automated, maintained on secure databases, and available to all Government agencies for source-selection purposes.  This practice would eventually lead to efficiencies similar to those in the private sector.  However, along the way, Government and private-sector industry have begun to disagree about how PPI is collected and how PPI is used.  Industry prefers a passive system of collecting delivery and quality data during contract performance, while Federal government uses both a passive system (similar to industry) as well as an active system of pulling PPI during contract performance.  Industry uses PPI to establish and maintain a preferred vendor list from which to solicit bids, quotes or proposals, while government uses PPI to assess risk and establish vendor responsibility in a full and open competition environment.  Contract award cycle-time within the Federal Acquisition process is more than double that of the private sector due to an evaluation process that is cumbersome, time-consuming, and lacking the efficiencies enjoyed by private industry.  Government (the DoD in particular) has recently become more curious regarding industry best practices and how those practices can be implemented in the government--in particular, as a possibility of diminishing the Government Contracting Officer's and the Source Selection team's added burden.  This paper will explore through field research the current PPI collection and evaluation process used by the DoD and by those employed in industry.  The goal behind such research is, again, industry best practices and improving the DoD's use of PPI as a tool in the acquisition processes.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aSecond Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2005/NPS-CM-05-049.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Joint contingencies encompass regional conflicts, humanitarian and peacekeeping missions, and international or domestic disaster relief missions supported with the immediate deployment of military forces.  This research was accomplished by reviewing the current guidance, policies, and doctrine pertinent to contingency contracting operations and conducting personal interviews.  The researchers conducted interviews with representatives of the Joint Staff, J4 (Logistics), each Service Component's acquisition headquarters, U.S. Central Command's J4 (Logistics), U.S. Pacific Command's J4 (Logistics, Engineering, and Security Assistance), and the DCMA to explore how contingency contracting operations are planned and executed; current issues and lessons learned; and understand the current structure/organization of Service Component and Combatant Command for accomplishing contingency contracting. Conclusions and recommendations address perceived shortfalls in the methodologies the Services use to plan, communicate, integrate and execute contingency contracting operations.  Three possible solutions to these shortfalls include adoption of the Yoder Three-Tier Model, establishment of the Joint Contingency Contracting Command (JCCC), and the creation of universal language for conducting contracting in contingencies.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aJohnson, Ellsworth K.;1 |aPaton, Bryan H.;1 |aThreat, Edward W.;1 |aHaptonstall, Lisa A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,," 0|aAcquisition research (Graduate School of Business & Public Policy, Naval Postgraduate School).",40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2005/NPS-CM-05-015.pdf,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This report uses an  operations research / decision analysis (OR/DA) approach to prototype the process of using smart  climatology data in planning, and identify challenges and key features of decision-relevant climatology  data system.",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aFunding number(s): N0017308WR00348.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 5/1/09,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aNaval Research Laboratory (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2008/NPS-64-08-001.pdf|z(719 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The United States Navy has established programs of record leveraging space, terrestrial, and maritime communications capabilities extending to fiscal year 2015. An ordered systems engineering process was performed to derive requirements and identify Joint ASW C4I Architecture strengths and weaknesses. This architecture is dependent upon the ASW community's ability to leverage current and planned  technologies impacting C4I areas including common operational tactical picture delivery, data transmission rate, time latency, and data fusion processes. Performance forecasts for identified alternatives were modeled and simulated based on a synthesized operational scenario using the EXTEND simulation tool, and life cycle cost estimates were produced for each alternative. Based on those outcomes, one of the several alternatives is recommended for implementation. In addition, it was discovered that programmed C4I capabilities lack an integrated fielding plan and do not properly align in FY2020. Furthermore, the ASW community must make  process changes to enable cross-program manager collaboration supported by a single system architect to ensure robust architectures are fielded by 2020.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 5/1/09,,,,, 0|aArchitecture.,,,,"1 |aClendening, Michael.;1 |aNew, James.;1 |aCuevas, Alejandro.;1 |aNgo, Van.;1 |aDhindsa, Amritpal.;1 |aPatel, Amrish.;1 |aHopkins, Dennis.;1 |aSaijid, Baasit.;1 |aLetourneau, Matthew.;1 |aTraganza, William.;1 |aLoy, Justin.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aSystems Engineering Department U.S.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-SE-09-001.pdf|z(8.90 MB);40|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA494773,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Major sources were the insufficient dynamic range of the site's multicouplers and their  inability to cope with the normal ambient signal environment as well as intermodulation components  generated from the operation of an onsite ionospheric sounder at full power. Time was not available to  identify the source of an erratic and high-level intermittent interference across the entire HF, VHF and  UHF bands. Other items noted are the many nonlinear joints in the antenna towers caused by welding  on galvanized steel, incidental contacts between wires and metal objects, and an unnecessary powerconversion  device to control the speed of a cabinet fan. The short visit did not provide time for the  investigation of the likely saturation of amplifiers located on the VHF/UHF antenna towers and the  saturation of the amplifiers incorporated into the HF loop antennas.

The objective of this Capstone project was to develop a methodology for creating complex combat system  architectures that emphasize the use of Software Product Lines (SPLs), requirements traceability, integrated supportability and  Modeling and Simulation (M&S) early and throughout the approach. To address this objective, an integrated methodology that  utilizes Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) to create open, supportable combat system architectures was developed.  The methodology was evaluated by applying it to a naval surface combatant Anti-Air Warfare (AAW) mission area.  Application of the methodology led to the following major findings: (1) Proven systems engineering practices, languages and  tools can be integrated with the MBSE approach for developing complex architectures, (2) Creation of domain centered SPLs  facilitates planned reuse and allows for assessment to candidate architectures, (3) Requirements traceability can be achieved by  using a combination of modeling languages and tools, (4) M&S application can extend beyond operational scenarios to address  life cycle cost, and (5) Engineers and logisticians can effectively use MBSE to integrate supportability into design. Overall,  this project demonstrated the benefits of an MBSE approach tailored to developing affordable and supportable combat system  architectures that meet mission requirements.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 5/8/09,,,,,,,,,"1 |aBanner-Bacin,  Linda.;1 |aCarpenter, Tim.;1 |aChacon, David.;1 |aChandler, James.;1 |aChilds, James.;1 |aHoang, Tuyen.;1 |aHoward, Robert.;1 |aIsaian, James.;1 |aKang, Seung.;1 |aKinberg, Michael.;1 |aKong, James.;1 |aManz, Jeremy.;1 |aMatela, Ruth.;1 |aMendiola, Jonathan.;1 |aO'Neil, John.;1 |aOriz, Leonard.;1 |aPham, Tan.;1 |aRayshouny, Jamal.;1 |aSarabia, Eric.;1 |aSung, Kihoon.;1 |aSysavath, Heng.;1 |aVajdos,  Caleb.;1 |aValdez, Armando.;1 |aVasquez, Armando.;1 |aWellesley, Alan.;1 |aWentland, Mindy.;1 |aWheeler, Paul.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-SE-09-002.pdf|z(7.23 MB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

This is a style of programming in which entire relations are manipulated rather than individual data. This is analogous to functional programming, wherein entire functions are the value manipulated by the operators. Because of its ability to manipulate complex data structures other than lists, relational programming seems to have distinct advantages over other very high level languages. This paper introduces the basic concepts of relational programming and a preliminary notation for expressing them; it does not define a programming language, per se.

Information provided by standard comparative sources is insufficient for military balance assessments, as baselines for force reduction negotiations, and for reinforcement planning. This paper was based on national publications and documents and direct assistance from European defense authorities and experts. Differences in countries' history and conditions have led to a diversity of manpower policies and force structures--which may limit the feasibility and desirability of standardization. Universality of military conscription is at best approximated. Lengths of regular duty and reserve obligations vary within nations. The peacetime armies of Denmark, West Germany, and Norway have 30, 51, and 80 percent conscripts, respectively. Longer term volunteers and conscripts with extended obligations tend to fill complex tasks. These countries have significant mobilization potentials with relatively high readiness.

The vertical resolution of the wind shear can be optimized by using linear combinations of radiance gradients. A theoretical study was conducted to determine the optimal pressure intervals over which wind shears could be resolved when using weighting functions associated with the SSH sounder of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program, and those associated with the TOVS instrument package on the TIROS-N/NOAA series of operational satellites. Two distinct computational approaches are presented and their respective results are summarized.

Data reported by earlier investigators permit estimates to be made also for sediments at the Nanoose and Jervis Inlet ranges. The purpose is to provide information which can be used in the design and evaluation of acoustic imaging devices which maybe able to ease the problems of locating and recovery of torpedoes which became buried in the sediments. Field and laboratory procedures are described. Also reported are the results of measured sound speeds in a number of the gravity core samples The most common surficial sediment is a soft, saturated silty-clay mud. For such sediments the sound absorption coefficient alpha in dB per meter should be given approximately by alpha = 0.1 where F is the sound frequency in kHz. It is concluded that sound absorption in these sediments, although not small, should not preclude the short range use of an acoustic imaging system operating at moderate frequencies.

Somewhat surprisingly, the subjects were able to correctly reject only 2 out of 6 deceitful clauses.

Contemporaneously, operations' tempo rose dramatically. This, plus government policies favoring outsourcing, led to a growth in importance of contracted support for military operations, and, correspondingly, an increasing prevalence of contractor personnel in proximity to combat. This paper reviews the legal status of civilian contractors in proximity to combat; control, discipline and force protection of such personnel, and the impact and cost effectiveness of contract support on combat operations. Particular attention is paid to the contracting process and its impact on the effective delivery of combat support. The adequacy of traditional contracting policies and processes for combat support functions and the need for possible changes are examined.The research found there had been a lag in updating policy and doctrine based on lessons learned and that on occasion a ""business as usual"" approach has decreased the efficiency of contracted contingency support. Serious deficiencies in organization and training for contingency contracting in support of joint operations persist.

A background on evolutionary acquisition is provided highlighting the benefit of rapid development and production of weapon systems incrementally, with each increment providing an increasing level of capability. The modular open systems approach (MOSA) is identified as an enabler for the evolutionary acquisition strategy, and a brief discussion on open systems is provided. The contractual implications of using a modular open systems approach is then discussed, focusing on each of the six phases of the procurement process. Examples of MOSA-specific contracting activities and documents are taken from recent US Navy weapons systems acquisition programs such as the Navy's Common Enterprise Display System (CEDS) program, Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW)/Undersea Warfare (USW) Test Information Management System program, Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) program, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) Mission Package Integrator program, Littoral Combat ship (LCS) Flight 0 Preliminary Design program, and the Navy's Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) program.

The current research presents a background summary and updates relevant policy developments since the earlier research. It then takes a distinctly different approach than the earlier study. Instead of trying to extract additional lessons from case studies of current events, this research attempts to gain historical perspective through case studies of earlier conflicts, primarily World War II. Rather than attempting to survey a catalog of issues, this research concentrates on a narrow set of issues.  The issues reviewed in this paper relate to the extent contractors can and should be made an integral part of the ""mission team"" in combat and contingency operations. If contractors have become integral to the success of combat and contingency operations, shouldn't they be responsive and responsible to the commander formally charged with mission success? Expressed another way, can and should the concept of ""unity of command"" be applied to contractors in a combat theater? Assuming that contractors should be integrated into joint task force operations in a way that creates the essence of unity of command, how can that be accomplished? The question of contractor control/unity of command can be relatively simply stated as suggested in the previous paragraph. This research found, however, that the path toward combatant commander control of contractors is complicated by divergent policies, conflicting belief systems, disconnections between policy theory and ""on the ground"" reality, and a variety of legal and regulatory hurdles. A key aspect of the commander's ability to control the forces in his theater, uniformed military or civilian contractor, is the ability to direct available forces to perform the most critical tasks when necessary. In a combat zone, the performance of critical tasks may involve activities that constitute or approach ""direct participation"" in combat. This is not an issue for uniformed military personnel; every soldier can be made a rifleman when necessary. However, civilians who directly participate in combat risk becoming illegal combatants under international law, compromise their potential status as prisoners of war, and potentially become subject to criminal sanctions. Civilian contractors may find themselves participating directly in combat because their contract work calls for such action (e.g., certain weapons system or security contractors) or due to exigent circumstances.   As pointed out in the author's earlier work, there are a number of issues concerning contractors in combat scenarios that need to be resolved. Policy developments have addressed many of these issues in a variety of ways. Progress continues to be made in a number of areas. Recent developments have not, however, assured that the theater commander has effective control over contractor personnel in his area of responsibility. Current policy purports to prohibit direct participation in combat by contractors; but, there seems to be no rigorous method to ensure that contractors (either as part of contract work or due to exigent circumstances) do not actually participate in combat. Moreover, the concept of ""direct participation"" is not fixed in international law but is still evolving. This research aims to examine both these areas and, if possible recommend policies and approaches that will assure that the theater commander and his subordinates effectively control civilian contractors that support them; and, that only uniformed military personnel will actually participate in combat. Both ""participation"" and ""combat"" itself may be more amorphous in a war on terrorism than in some other conflicts. A corollary to the commander's control of the activities of contractor personnel is the concern that civilian contractors that are exposed to the risks of combat receive the same force protection, administrative support, and amenities afforded to soldiers under similar circumstances.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |akmc/kmc oclc 6/12/09.,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,, 0|aThird Annual Acquisition Research Symposium.,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2006/NPS-CM-06-090.pdf,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Strategic sourcing is one such process.  The objective of strategic sourcing is the creation and application of carefully crafted procurement strategies to acquire various supplies and services at the lowest total cost.  While numerous sourcing strategies exist (e.g., those for strategic items, leverage items, bottleneck items, and noncritical items), this study focused on leverage items and the use of commodity councils, specifically the Air Force Information Technology Commodity Council (AFITCC).  Using a case study approach, this research identified the specific factors that contributed to the successful development and implementation of AFITCC.  These factors included the development of an overall sourcing strategy, the utilization of an appropriate commodity strategy, and the ability to implement change within an organization.  Thus, by documenting specific challenges and successes, this research should help to guide the development and implementation of commodity councils throughout the Air Force, DoD, and various other public organizations.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirement: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |akmc/kmc oclc 6/12/09.,,,,, 0|aBusiness logistics.; 0|aOrganizational change.,,,,"1 |aShelby, Heather.;1 |aStrobel, Timothy J.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bGraduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,,,40|uhttp://www.acquisitionresearch.net/_files/FY2006/NPS-CM-06-006.pdf,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The FISC, Norfolk, OTD, Container Freight Station has been at the forefront of DoD activities implementing passive RFID and is currently using RFID tags to process all shipments except household goods. DDJC is equipped with RFID readers and the required supporting infrastructure, and has been accepting pallets and cases with passive RFID tags since January 2005. DoD is in the midst of a fundamental transformation of its logistics capabilities, and RFID is becoming an integral element of that transformation with the potential to revolutionize the entire supply chain. On July 30, 2004, the Acting Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics issued a memorandum delineating the final policy and an extensive plan for RFID implementation within DoD.

It examines the overall situation in order to assess the political and military goals, required composition of force, equipment, training, financial implications, circumstances of deployment and effectiveness of the peacekeeping operation required. The UN does not have any permanent force structure; it is dependent on its member States for contribution of forces, though the equipment may or may not be provided by the troops' contributing countries. The UN has a standard procedure for acquiring peacekeeping operations/services. The process is a contract between the United Nations' Department of Peacekeeping Operations (UNDPKO) and the troops' contributing countries.

Conclusions are drawn and recommendations are outlined for optimum methods of contracting for husbanding services as requested by the Worldwide Husbanding Process Improvement Action Team.  Historical husbanding contract data were reviewed, including constraints and desired performance criteria.  Implementation of a flat-rate, low-variability, well-defined and constant set of requirements minimizes risk and price fluctuations.

Strategic approaches to procurement are successful in both industry and the Department of Defense; however, the contingency arena is often overlooked. Corporations are finding a strategic enterprise orientation to procurement can create or enhance their own competitive position within a market. This is done by identifying opportunities to leverage purchases--thus reducing costs by more than any subsequent trade-off to product market value or identifying opportunities to increase product value by more than any subsequent trade-off to cost.  Indeed, the purpose of competitive advantage is to create the largest delta between a cost position and product market value or customer willingness-to-pay.  This project applies the principles of competitive advantage and, with them, creates a strategic approach to contingency contracting operations. This paper first recommends the DoD create a centralized activity, such as Joint Contracting Command-Iraq/Afghanistan, to consolidate contracting activities within a Combatant Commander's contingency theater. Secondarily, this discussion suggests the DoD initiate spend analysis of all contracting activities within Combatant Command geographic regions. The DoD can identify opportunities to capture maximum value from key regional suppliers.

It is especially important to do so in cutting-edge programs with a history of complexity, difficulty or controversy   Deservedly or not, the lead system integrator (LSI) approach used in the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program has been criticized for relying too heavily on private industry to manage this innovative, large scale acquisition program.  The objections from Congress center on government's surrender of too much of its responsibility, authority, and budget to private industry.  As a result of the concern over the use of LSIs, program managers are understandably interested in minimizing risk to better control costs, schedule, and performance.  In order to minimize risk, it is essential that contracts are written well, with appropriate specificity, and include not only the desired goods or services, but also essential information that enables the program manager to track the progress of contract performance and to quickly detect potential problems.

An important example of this type of problem is the prediction of tropical cyclones. This study tests a simple finite element prediction model with a variable element size. The shallow water equations are used and the motion is confined in a periodic channel on a f-plane. The Galerkin technique is applied to linear basis functions on triangular elements. The model uses leapfrog time differencing and periodic restarts. The model is tested with a wave imbedded in a mean flow and also with an isolated vortex. The experiments with a uniform element size show excellent phase propagation, but some small scale noise is generated. The introduction of momentum diffusion terms helps to control the noise. The model is also tested with elements which decrease abruptly in scale along a line with elements which decrease smoothly. Both of these cases generate more noise than with uniform elements.

An inviscid, adiabatic primitive equation model is used to simulate steady, vertically-unsheared flow past a mountain range; various cases of mountain height and width are analyzed.  A similar model for two-dimensional Boussinesq flow past a mountain on an f-plane is solved analytically following Merkine (1975) for comparison to the numerical solution.  Results indicate that the atmospheric response is quite similar to that observed in the Boussinesq model.  Ridging over the mountains and responses which damp in the vertical are observed in both models.  Differences are noted in the magnitude of the response in the vicinity of the mountains and in the position of the downstream trough.  In addition, the effect of finite difference model grid resolution is investigated by comparing simulations based on differing horizontal and vertical resolution.  Results indicate that for larger scale mountains, the effect of poorer horizontal resolution is significant; vertical resolution, however, is relatively unimportant.  As the horizontal scale of the mountains is reduced, vertical resolution becomes increasingly more important so that the effects of both horizontal and vertical resolution are significant.

Air ducting methods were found to affect combustion efficiency through port flow rates, bypass dump momentum and geometry and bypass ratio. Bypass configurations with plexiglas fuel altered the heat transfer mechanisms within the port and decreased combustion efficiency. The analytical model was found to be in qualitative agreement with experimental data. Finite rate kinetics and radiative transfer to the fuel surface will be required in the model to obtain more quantitative accuracy.

It is even more difficult to diagnose cross-domain issues without  complete knowledge of observations and topology from neighboring network domains. For both competitive and security  reasons, domain managers hesitate to share observations even when doing so may significantly ease fault localization. In this  paper, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of the feasibility of cross-domain fault localization. Leveraging a recent  graph-digest based formulation of the problem, we have developed a set of practical metrics and performed extensive  experiments to evaluate two key questions: Does cross-domain fault localization offer the kinds of benefits warranting further  research? Can it provide deployable and acceptable privacy protection with manageable complexity? We evaluate both  provider-customer and peering relationship scenarios between small, medium, and large domains. Our results show that crossdomain  fault localization is effective using the graph-digest approach and that sensitive network connectivity properties can be  concealed from other domains.",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aFunding numbers: CNS-0520210 ; CNS-0721574.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 7/7/09,,,,, 0|aArtificial intelligence.,,,,"1 |aXie, Georey G.;1 |aYoung, Joel D.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aNational Science Foundation (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-CS-09-007.pdf|z(381 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

For now, preliminary data have been collected, with anatomical measures obtained for the heads and inner ears of two beaked and two minke whales, as well as for 10 ears from these and additional animals. A partial frequency range map for the minke has been completed via CT and histologic data.

The added mass and damping coefficients for the structure oscillating in all six degrees of freedom is computed. Then, the hydrodynamic coefficients associated with both the wave/structure interaction and the oscillation of the structure are determined by use of a Green's function method using quadralateral elements of constant source strength which applies to large structures of rather general shape. The analysis is based on linear theory and viscous effects are neglected on the basis that the size of the structure is large in relation to the amplitude of the incident wave. Also, the equations of motion for a free-floating body are developed which yields the dynamic response of a floating body with linear mooring line forces. Finally, the computer program capable of carrying out the numerical calculations is outlined and the input/output is discussed in some detail.

The firings were conducted on 2 February 1979 utilizing the A-10/GAU-8 weapon system and ammunition from LAVP Lot Number OL78D-43-016.  Targets for the firings were 31 US M-47 tanks arranged in a static formation to simulate a Soviet MBT Battalion of three ten (10) tank companies and a battalion commander tank.  Also included in the target array were four plywood mock-ups, simulating the tank battalion's ZSU-23/4anti-aircraft defense.  Five A-10 pilots conducted firing passes at the formation of M-47 target tanks and ZSU-23/4 mock-ups.  Normal A-10 operational tactics for low altitude, low dive angle attacks were followed.  This publication contains a description of the firing conditions, A-10 attack parameters, weapons effects  derived from the firings, and individual damage assessments for each target tank in the array.  The data collected from this test verify the acceptability of the ammunition lot tested, and the effectiveness of the A-10/GAU-8 weapon system as one capable of inflicting catastrophic (K), mobility (M), and firepower (F) kills against modern main battle tanks.

An in depth analysis is made of one of the informal elements of the model, 'linker-stabilizer behavior.' The analysis is based on two studies of technically trained personnel; one, Naval Officers, and the Second, Government Service Employees. The thrust of the analysis and the conclusion seem to indicate strongly that the commonality of the technical training is more dominant than the decision to be a Naval Officer or a Government Service Employee.

This project serves as an initial step in determining  whether the Navy can consolidate C2 systems by defining a common C2 system architecture and  requirements that can be applied across all surface combatants for the Surface Warfare and  Maritime Interception Operations missions. The project applied a systems engineering process  consisting of a needs analysis, functional analysis, and modeling and cost analysis. The needs  analysis defined key user objectives and needs and identified threats to Navy platforms. The  functional analysis included the core tasks of requirements definition and enterprise architecture.  The modeling and cost analysis task verified the C2 system architecture and evaluated possible  training course hour savings. The project found that the definition of a common set of C2 system  requirements and system architecture is feasible and does provide possible life cycle cost savings  to the Navy. In order to fully evaluate a proposed common C2 system, further work will be  required, expanding the analysis to other missions and assessing the cost impacts of a common  C2 system",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 8/12/09,,,,00|aSafety standards series.|pRequirements., 0|aSystems engineering.; 0|aArchitecture.,,,,"1 |aAcosta, Elvis.;1 |aBarta, Jordan.;1 |aBeger-Mason, Joanna.;1 |aDonovan,  Harry.;1 |aEak, Matt.;1 |aFinley, Dave.;1 |aGalace, Llewelynn.;1 |aJones, Brian.;1 |aMaurseth, Andrina.;1 |aMetz, Lee.;1 |aPainchaud, Lesley.;1 |aPepper, Josh.;1 |aSuchit, Reshma.;1 |aTidwell, Rob.;1 |aYu, David.;1 |aZanella, Bob.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);2 |aU.S. Systems Engineering Department U.S.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-SE-09-003.pdf|z(1.89 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA501867,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tBOOK|xORIGINAL,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Among them, precision pointing of laser beam and high-bandwidth rejection of jitters produced by platform vibrations are one of the key technologies for the emerging fields of laser communications and HEL systems.  HEL testbed has been developed to support the research environments on the precision beam control technology including acquisition, tracking, and pointing. The testbed incorporates optical table, two axis gimbal, high speed computers, and a variety of servo components, sensors, optical components, and software. In this report, system configuration and operation modes of the testbed are briefly introduced.

Aircraft design is singled out as a field where demands on design are particularly high and urgent. Basic needs are determined. Additional challenges posed by engineering technology, continuing studies, liberal-technical education, and new concepts of professionalism are discussed. An overall perspective is developed which foresees a dynamic evolutionary process and indicates that much initiative should originate on the faculty level while guidance should be provided on a policy-making level.

Second, we show that in terms of transaction execution cost and DBS throughput, there are some applications for which any distributed DBS can be more effective than any centralized DBS and vice versa. We also argue that for other applications the decision in favour of distributed or centralized DBS should be based on the comparison of specific DBS systems.

The development of a database management system for the office automation environment becomes a high priority, in order to provide an efficient and reliable way to manage the information needs of the office. Therefore, the specification of a database server for the office automation environment becomes a key area of concern. In addition to providing traditional database support, the database server must also provide new database support, so as to meet the unique and many needs of office automation environments. This paper focuses on the characterization and specification of a database server for the office automation environment. It also considers how such a database server can be effectively integrated into the office automation environment. The authors use both intuitive comparisons and queing-theory analyses to evaluate the various integration approaches. Further, they examine an experimental database system, known as the multibackend database system, as a candidate for the database server in the office automation environment.

This doctrine envisions an extended battlefield, not confined to a narrow belt around the forward edge of the (main) battle area (FEBA). Inherent in this doctrine is a concept of target value analysis which attempts to identify targets on the extended battlefield in terms of their values, which may be situationally dependent. Such analysis is crucial to the successful conduct of the Airland Battle, since the battlefield environment is target rich, but asset limited, and therefore these limited assets must be allocated to maximize effectiveness. This paper proposes and develops a structure for assigning value, consistently, to the varied and diverse targets that populate the Airland battlefield. These values will be used as inputs ot allocation and decision modules in a systemic Corps-level Airland Research Model under development at the Naval Postgraduate School. Key elements of the proposed structure are that the values of noncombatant targets must be derived from the values of combatant targets that are supported, and that the effect of time increments and delays on value is incorporated through exponential discounting.",,,,,,,,  |akmc/kmc 9/9/09.,,,,,,,,,"1 |aParry, Samuel H.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

It is argued that if AI is to accomplish its goals, especially in the tasks of sensory interpretation and sensorimotor coordination, then it must solve the problem of representing embodied practical knowledge. Biological evidence shows that animals use this knowledge in a way very different form digital computation. This suggests that if these problems are to be solved, then we will need a new breed of computers, which we call field computers. Examples of field computers are: neurocomputers, optical computers, molecular computers, and any kind of massively parallel analog computer. The author claims that the principle characteristic of all these computers is their massive parallelism, but we use this term in a special way. He argues that true massive parallelism comes when the number of processors is so large that it can be considered a continuous quantity. Designing and programming these computers requires a new theory of computation, one version of which is presented in this paper. Described is a universal field computer, that is, a field computer that can emulate any other field computer. It is based on a generalization of Taylor's theorem to continuous dimensional vector spaces. A number of field computations are illustrated, including several transformations useful in image understanding, and a continuous version of Kosko's bidirectional associative memory.",,,,,,,,  |akmc/kmc 11/4/09.,,,,," 0|aArtificial intelligence.; 0|aNeural computers.; 0|aComputers, Optical.; 0|aMolecular computers.",,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The first is to perform a literature survey of the problem solving and artificial intelligence literature relevant to Navy needs. The second objective is to investigate approaches to problem solving that could be taught to Naval officers for use in their jobs. This survey has found a growing interest in the area of problem solving. This interest began with work in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence in the 1950's and gradually spread to influence education and management. There is little evidence in the literature to indicate that teaching generic problem solving produces improvement in problem solving abilities. One factor complicating this is the lack of adequate definitions of problem solving skills and the lack of test instruments to measure these skills. Some authors suggest that generic problem solving skills are best taught in the context of more conventional courses.

Who among the people of a nation should be its ""guardians""?  Who should have the right or responsibility for shouldering the burdens of national defense?  The concept of ""representation"" is first introduced, with reference to its application within the American military.  Basic issues are then examined for three general areas of national policy: social equity, political legitimacy, and military effectiveness.  Several competing themes are found, and the author suggests that a ""reasonable balance"" may be the only way to reconcile differences between opposing policy objectives.  The discussion of issues and conflicts sets the stage for the main subject of the monograph, participation by blacks in the all-volunteer military.  Modern trends in racial representation are reviewed, including the recent surge in enlistments by blacks.  The possible cuases and contributing factors for these trends are also evaluated.  The discussion then turns to racial representation questions for the 1980s-- focusing on race and equity, race and effectiveness (using individual quality and performance indicators), and aspects of unit performance.  Various ""running currents of thought"" are identified in an essay tracing the participation by blacks in the military from colonial times to present.  The author finds that many ""currents"" have persistently followed the military through its entire past, and most will continue to run for some time to come.  In a concluding note, the author offers a positive, yet cautionary outlook for the future.

Organizationally, the role of DCSPLANS within U.S. Army MilPerCen is identified and implementation of a civilian billet for data administration recommended as a first step towards controlling data resources. Technologically, a relational dictionary system is designed to support this data administrator. The dictionary is compatible with emerging Federal Standards.

A practical scheme is given, based on a maximum transformation in a two-way layout of the data, which reduces the sample size sufficiently to allow an experimenter to obtain a point estimate of an extreme quantile. Three schemes are then given which lead to confidence interval estimates for the quantile. One uses a spectral analysis of the reduced sample.

Sur, California over the past 12 years are examined for statistical and oceanographic content. Spectral analysis of the data reveals an annual cycle and two harmonics, but no obvious influence from the local winds or tides. A statistical model has been constructed based on a decomposition of the data into its various deterministic and random components. As expected, the model provides forecasts which are significantly better than those that would be obtained from a simple climatological treatment of the data alone. The model is also used to generate simulated series, which in turn are used as a basis to estimate adequate sampling rates. In 6 years of the 12 year record, an abrupt major decrease in SST was observed between February and April and has been identified as the spring transition to coastal upwelling. One such transition was found to occur almost simultaneously at three locations; including Pt. Sur, along the California coast between Pt. Conception and San Francisco. The data also indicate that a well-defined annual temperature cycle does exist at Pt. Sur although its range is reduced and its maximum occurs later in the year than would normally be expected at this latitude. Three El Nino events are clearly evident in the 12-year record including the present El Nino; SSTs have increased by almost 3C at Pt. Sur as a result of the present El Nino warning. Over the whole 12 year period an average increase in temperature of 1.6 C was found.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 9/21/09.,,,,, 0|aOcean temperature|zNorth Pacific Ocean.; 0|aOcean temperature|zCalifornia.,,,,"1 |aLewis, P.

It is shown that for a subclass of this two-parameter family extension to mixed exponential marginals is possible, giving a model of broad applicability for analyzing data and modelling stochastic systems, although negative correlation is more difficult to obtain than in the exponential case. Finally, two schemes for autoregressive sequences with Gamma distributed marginals are outlined. Efficient simulation of some of these schemes is discussed.

The stationary series is modelled with a newly developed type of second order autoregressive process with random coefficients, called the NEAR(2) model; it has a second order autoregressive correlation structure but is nonlinear because its coefficients are random. The exponential distributional assumptions involved in this model highlight a very broad four parameter structure which combines five exponential random variables into a sixth exponential random variable; other applications of this structure are briefly considered. Dependency in the NEAR(2) process not accounted for by standard autocorrelations is explored by developing a residual analysis for time series having autoregressive correlation structure; this involves defining linear uncorrelated residuals which are dependent, and then assessing this higher order dependence by standard time series computations.

The proposed analysis involves crosscorrelation of the usual linear residuals and their squares. This function is obtained for the two types of model considered, and allows differentiation between models with the same autocorrelation structure in the same class. For the random coefficient models it is shown that one side of the crosscorrelation function is zero, giving a useful signature of these processes.

Responses were received from 177 business firms in a variety of industries and from 70 military installations. The primary practices reported are the uses of various financial criteria for assesssing the profitability of a proposed capital investment. Attention is given to use of these criteria in special situations and to some of the problems that may be associated with using them. The condition of capital rationing is explored to determine the extent of its occurrence, the causes of it, and the practices adopted by management to deal with it. Finally, the respondents offer their views as to the most critical and the most difficult phases of the total capital budgeting process. The report includes critical comments by the author to set the practices reported in an appropriate theoretical context.

The above theory is applied to the following cases: (1) lethality of each side's fire proportional to a power of time, and (2) lethality of each side's fire linear with time but a nonconstant ratio of these.

The C*-Criterion specifies that the time response of this quantity called C* must fall in a prescribed envelope for all speeds and altitudes. It is equivalent to requiring the control system to hold the coefficients of a certain equation, which describes the aircraft's short-period motion, fixed. This is done by using feedbacks with variable gains. The gain-changing mechanism is found using gradient techniques. The system was shown to be practical by an analog simulation. It was found to be tolerant of instrument noise, elevator hysteresis, and other complications not accounted in the analytical derivations. The study strongly suggests a modification of the C*-Criterion. It is proposed that the coefficients in the expression of the quantity C* should be representative of the aircraft's parameters rather than have the values currently in use.

The three corresponding finite difference schemes are also included in the study. The development follows Schoenstadt (1980) wherein the spatially discretized equations are Fourier transformed in x, and then solved with arbitrary initial conditions. The six schemes are also compared by integrating them numerically from an initial state at rest with a height perturbation at a single point. The finite difference and finite element primitive equation schemes with unstaggered grid points give very poor results for the small scale features. The staggered scheme B gives much better results with both finite differences and finite elements. The vorticity-divergence system with unstaggered points also is very good with finite differences and finite elements. It is especially important to take into account these results when formulating efficient finite element prediction models.

The severe restriction on output created by the electrical breakdown limit of the medium is clearly shown. The method for computing the net-electrical work output per unit mass of primary fluid and the net overall thermal efficiency of the system is carefully developed.

The acceleration vector was perpendicular to and into the burning surface. Propellant strands were burned in a combustion bomb mounted on a centrifuge, and surge tanks were employed to ensure essentially constant pressure burning at 500, 1000, and 1500 psia. The burning rates of both aluminized and non-aluminized composite propellants were found to depend on acceleration. The effect of acceleration on burning rate was found to depend on the burning rate of the propellant without acceleration, aluminum mass loading, and aluminum mass median particle size. The relative burning rate increase was found to be greater for slow burning propellant than for faster burning propellants. The experimental results are compared to the analytical models proposed by Crowe for aluminized propellants and by Glick for non-aluminized propellants. The results indicate that these models do not adequately predict the observed relative burning rate increase with acceleration, and hence, that more complex modeling will be required to explain the observed acceleration effect.

At sufficiently low pressures, ideal gas behavior prevails and temperature may be used as the single independent variable. The algorithm for nested multiplication is presented, optimized for hand-held or desktop electronic calculators. Using the polynomial approximations and a suitable calculator, it is possible to duplicate existing reference source tabular values directly, obviating the need for interpolation or further reference to the tables per se.

Ammunition used in the attacks comprised Aerojet Lot Number AJD 79A181-001 30mm armor piercing incendiary (API) rounds, which proved to be effective damage agents against substantial areas of the U.S M-47 tanks used as targets. The pilots in ten successful firing passes expended a total of 1349 rounds of which 243 impacted the targets. Of the projectiles impacting on target, 42 achieved perforations of the armored envelope. The simulated soviet tank company was destroyed as a combat formation with seven tanks being totally immobilized immediately. One additional tank would have been immobilized immediately. One additional tank would have been immobilized after approximately 500 meters of further movement. Among those eight tanks noted above as immobilized, three suffered catastrophic damage from perforating projectile which penetrated into the fuel tanks and ignited diesel fuel.

A joint effort with the Naval Air Propulsion Center, the Environmental Protection Agency/Northrup Services, Inc. and PMTC, Pt. Mugu was conducted to obtain detailed data over a one-week period. Much of the measured pollution concentration data (including all of the suspended particulate data) was lost due to instrument and measurement technique problems. This severely limited the validation effort. Comparison of model predictions with the limited initial measured concentration data indicated that: (1) predicted CO concentrations were in good agreement with measurement, (2) predicted NOX concentrations from aircraft idle/taxi operations were too low, and (3) predicted total hydrocarbons and particulate concentrations were too high for aircraft idle/taxi operations and too low for environ sources. Model predictions were significantly improved by increasing engine RPM settings to above idle for all modes normally specified as idle. Model validation efforts would be improved if one-half integer stability categories could be measured and used in the model. (Author)",,,,,,,,  |aGutted record reput. 12/11/97. dln.

In addition to the usual prognostic variables that exist in a multi-level primitive equation model, the embedded model predicts the depth of the well mixed layer as well as the jumps in temperature and velocity that occur at the base of that layer. The depth of the mixed layer need not coincide with any of the fixed model levels used in the primitive equations calculations. In addition to advective changes, the mixed layer can deepen by entrainment and it can reform at a shallower depth in the absence of entrainment. When the mixed layer reforms at a shallower depth, the vertical profile of temperature below, the new, shallower mixed layer is adjusted to fit the fixed-level structure used in the primitive equations calculations using a method which conserves heat, momentum and potential energy. Finally, a dynamic stability condition, which includes a consideration of both the vertical current shear and the vertical temperature gradient, is introduced in place of the traditional 'convective adjustment)'. A two-dimensional version of the model is used to test the embedded model formulations and to study the response of the ocean to a stationary axisymmetric hurricane. The model results indicate a strong interdependence between vertical turbulent mixing and advection of heat.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 6/10/09.,,,,, 0|aOcean circulation|xMathematical models.; 0|aOcean-atmosphere interaction|xMathematical models.,,,,"1 |aElsberry, Russell L.;1 |aGarwood, Roland W.;1 |aHaney, Robert Lee.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aGC228.5|b.A22|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768000447320,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Command and Control assets for each participant are modeled as endowed with the capacity to guide combat; C2 is also vulnerable in that it may be deliberately targetted and reduced in effectiveness. Physical attrition is modeled first by a deterministic rate process (Lanchesterian in nature), secondly by a stochastic process related to the first by ideas related to those of stochastic difference and differential equations. The models are best exercised and explored on an interactive computer display. A FORTRAN program exists for this purpose, with displays of hypothetical historical combat outcomes new appearing in tabular form. Graphical displays will be provided in future work. It seems likely that this model simulation can be developed into a gaming tool, very conveniently playable by two persons who can elect various strategies for force allocation, play the game, and learn from the results. An elaboration of the model may serve as a means for assessing the importance of increased effectiveness of equipment, either with respect to firing rate and accuracy or time for information flow.

One class consists of blocking CC mechanisms and two classes contain nonblocking CC mechanisms. We define CC overhead and derive it for conflicting and nonconflicting transactions for each class of CC mechanisms. Since CC overhead is dependent on CC mechanism only, it can be used as a metric for comparison of CC mechanisms and as a measure of CC load on DDBMS resources. We also describe two new nonblocking distributed concurrency control mechanisms which use the concept of multiple data object versions. One is based on time stamp ordering of transaction execution and the other is based on nonserializable execution detection and recovery to serializable execution.

Live signals in the HF band are monitored by applying the predetected output of an R-390A receiver directly to the signal analyzer. Photographs of the actual displays resulting from signals generated in the laboratory demonstrate the ability of the system to provide a distinctive display in each case. Various parameters of the input signal can be determined by measuring parameters of the display. The ability of the signal analyzer to determine the normalized autocorrelation function of a bandpass gaussian process is demonstrated.

The eigencurrents are shown to provide bases for the irreducible representations of the symmetry group. It is further proven that expansion of the current in terms of functions belonging to the irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the structure leads to block diagonalization of the matrix representations of the operator. Basis functions for bodies of revolution are discussed. Finally, perturbations are considered and it is argued that symmetry determines exactly the splitting of any degenerate resonances of the unperturbed conducting body.

The conception of this instrument and some preliminary measurements represent the body of this report.  The EGD anemometer consists of an injector of unipolar charged particles fed into the flow to the probed, an equilibration region, and a collector for the charges.  The particles are many times heavier than the molecules in the gas and they interact with the flow through drag forces.  If these particles are tightly coupled to the flow, then the collecting probe receives information in electrical form about the fluid velocity.  Besides being a direct velocity measurement, the probe can be of streamlined shape and very rugged, and it is insensitive to temperature differences in the flow.  The charged particles can be chosen so as to give the desired range of frequency response.  The instrument is sensitive to impurities in the flow but in principle the effect may be calibrated out.  An EGD spectral anemometer has been tested using water droplets charged as they condense through a corona discharge.   The anemometer consists of a short-circuited EGD generator; this is the first time that such an application has been reported and a Navy patent has been awarded for this device.  The feasibility of the anemometer depends on the magnitude of the charged particle slip.  The coupling between the flow field and the electric field depends on the frequency range of the velocity fluctuations as well as on the charge, size, and mass of the particles.  The work treats the mass as a first order perturbation, in the particle momentum equation.  The unsteady flow studied is a region in the wake of a cylinder where charged water droplets are injected and the observed frequency response of the anemometer tested.  The EGD spectral anemometer data are compared to hot-wire data taken at the same location; some results compare within (+/_-) 2 dbs up to a frequency of 630 Hz whereas others are within (+/-) 6 dbs up to 20 KHz.  The parameters which varied are the steam pressure and temperature, and the corona characteristics.  Predictions of frequency response as a function of charged particle size are given.

It is suggested that refined measurement techniques are needed to check on just what is being injected into the flow. The effects of turbulence on the EHD process and, particularly, on breakdown are being studied. The report discusses in some detail the possible role of turbulence on the mean effective mobility of charged particles. On the experimental side, a laboratory facility was built and then improved by the addition of a larger test section and other equipment. Work is proceeding to further develop and refine the instrumentation. Two types of injectors were operated, namely, molecular and two phase, and the latter shows potential for efficient operation. It was concluded tentatively that turbulence in the carrier fluid increases its breakdown potential, and that turbulent air may be a suitable medium for the EHD energy conversion process.

The two-phase injector is used exclusively. Spectral measurements of velocity and collector current are reported. These are used to determine the potential use of EHD in anemometry and to deduce particle size distributions. Measurements of charge distribution are also reported and a comparison is made between these and the spectral measurements. Equations defining an axisymmetric, turbulent EHD flow have been derived. Also, the feasibility of flow separation control with an EHD interaction has been investigated.

The carrier fluid is treated as incompressible and turbulent.  The injected particles are treated as uniform in mass and electrical charge.  The analysis is broken down into three phases, namely, the basic flow, the perturbation due to injection of mass, and the perturbation due to introduction of electrical charge.  This method greatly simplifies and improves the analysis.  A final system of nine basic partial differential equations is obtained.  These equations, along with the appropriate boundary conditions, fix the fluid and particle velocities and particle density at all points in the field.  The basic equations are developed in a fully non-dimensional form.  The mathematical model here presented is unique in its analytical approach and in its treatment of turbulence effects.  Through computer simulation, it offers new possibilities for the study and development of EHD power generation systems.  The analytical model has been developed to the point where it sis ready for computer programming.  Such a program would be useful for estimating optimum design parameters and performance possibilities for a wide variety of axi-symmetric configurations and a wide range of operating conditions.

The author discusses limitations, when the probability level alpha is very high or very low, of two basic methods of estimating quantiles. One method is the direct use of order statistics; the other is based on the use of stochastic approximation. Several modifications of these two estimation schemes are considered.

Results of experimental work are not included but are referred to in appropriate places. The classical solution for ambipolar diffusion in the positive column of the glow discharge must be extended to reflect the influence of current and pressure. The influence of current is given by the inclusion of appropriate energy equations and the pressure influence by the addition of two-body recombination. It was found that, from dimensional analysis, the characteristic lengths for ambipolar and heat diffusion for helium do not match. A re-formulation of the problem is thus necessary. The recombination term does not change the eigenvalue nature of the diffussion equation except at the stationary or local equilibrium limit.

The central goal is to assess the sensitivity of 'collision' probability to a shift in expected reaction time. This problem eventually reduces to determining the sensitivity of the probability of 'ruin' to changes in the drift of the process of cumulative reaction times. 'Diffusion-type' approximations are used and it is found that additive changes in mean reaction time correspond to multiplicative changes in 'collision' probability. Numerical examples are given to illustrate this effect.

The evaporation duct height, Z*, was found to vary from 1.0 meters to 25 meters with a typical value of 16 meters. A comparison with profile and turbulence methods showed that the bulk method was accurate to within a factor of two, although some of the disagreement has been attributed to profile measurement inaccuracies.

It is concluded that some modification is necessary to achieve one percent uniformity for the mean velocity at the test cascade inlet plane and several approaches are suggested.  From a study of simple analyses for turbulent wakes and of the effects of wire gauze screens, it is predicted that the desired uniformity may be obtained by installing a single screen of high resistance coefficient; the necessary pressure drop and turning of the flow would be substantial.

The amplitude of the correlation function is greatest during the active phase of the mouse's diurnal cycle. Additionally, mean LSC (averaged across circadian phase) is significantly positive and monotonically decreasing for a broad range of short lags (1-23 minutes). Thus there is no evidence of positive, periodically occurring peaks in the correlation function separated by patches of small or negative correlations that is characteristic of a rhythmic process of fixed period.

The problem is most simply stated in the propositional calculus: given a goal A and hypothesis H we wish to find a formula P, called a precondition, such that A logically follows from both P and H. A precondition provides any additional conditions under which A can be shown to follow from H. A slightly more complex definition of preconditions in a first-order theory is given and used throughout the paper. A formal system based on natural deduction is presented in which preconditions can be derived. A number of examples are then given which show how derived preconditions are used in a program synthesis method we are developing. These uses include theorem proving, formula simplification, simple code generation, the completion of partial specifications for a subalgorithm, and other tasks of a deductive nature.

The thesis examines and analyzes these functions in detail and proposes a solution in the form of a system, data base and interactive user design. The resultant Microcomputer System for Target Information (MISTI) employs an ALTOS Z-80 microcomputer, the UCSD Pascal operating system, a user friendly interface and data base technology.

The technique utilizes linear regression equations to reduce systemic errors. Backward extrapolation positions are presented as a less expensive, but inferior, alternative to the backward integration positions required by the original technique. A scheme is developed for applying the technique in storm-motion coordinates as well as zonal-meridional coordinates. Tests with 186 NTCM cases indicate moderate improvement in forecast errors by the zonal-meridional regression technique, and slight improvement by the storm-coordinate scheme. In TCMO tests with 212 cases, the zonal-meridional regression equations reduced the forecast errors, but the storm-coordinate equations did not. The technique failed to improve forecast errors in independent tests with NTCM 1981 data, presumably due to differences in error biases, which indicates a need for a larger sample size. Alternatively backward integration positions may be necessary to achieve consistent improvements from this statistical technique. The technique was able to improve 60h-72h forecast errors in TCMO 1981 cases.

It is also the phase which has received insufficient attention by management and software developers. Software standards have improved the ability of the software community to develop and design software. Unfortunately, most standards do not deal with the maintenance phase in a substantive way. Since maintainability has to be designed into the software and cannot be achieved after the software is delivered, it is necessary to have software standards which explicitly incorporate requirements for maintainability. Accordingly, this report suggests design criteria for achieving maintainability and evaluates Weapons Specification WS 8506 and MIL-STD 1679 against these criteria. Using these documents as typical examples of military software standards, recommendations are made for improving the maintainability aspects of software standards.

Data gained since the 1930's is subdivided for convenience into diffusing, or compressor-type flows, and accelerating, or turbine-type flows. There is a further sub-division into cascade and rotating machinery data. The overall trend university is that an increasing tip gap whose effect can reach over most or all of the blade height brings reduced overall performance of a turbomachine. Turbine data are in general more regular than the body of compressor data, possibly due in part to the enhanced effect of, usually, undefined boundary layers in diffusing flow. there is some evidence among the compressor and compressor cascade data that an optimum gap exists when the opposing effects of secondary flows, and tip leakage with rotor/wall relative movement tend to balance. Comment is made upon the prediction and design models published in the literature.

This decision is under a continuing review through the acquisition life cycle. This report examines the decision against a broad background which includes insights into the Third World and European aircraft self-production patterns; the technological capability of the Israeli arms industry; Israel as arms supplier; Israel as a recipient of arms and security assistance. The report comprehensively analyzes the political and the economic aspects of the indigenous AFA decision. It concludes that political considerations should impact the decision only after considering the economic ones. The latter generally favor indigenous AFA. The major obstacle is the inflationary impact of the indigenous production, and that should be the determining ingredient in any further decision.

Exposure to this technology was accomplished over a 12 week period where the experimental group was provided with the tools and understanding to use the various research products. Data were collected from this experimental group prior to and after the 12 week period. Analysis of the data revealed interesting aspects concerning a user's perception of the value or utility of computer systems and computer software designed specifically to enhance the human-system interaction.

Aside from the convenience of a syntax directed editor, it is also a very efficient parser. No syntactic error recovery is required since the editor does not permit the user to make syntactic errors. Some of the implications of syntax directed editors for data structure manipulation and two dimensional languages are briefly discussed.

Therefore there is no real consumption nor any real production of energy but, instead, processes converting energy from one quality into another quality. In this report are formulated a number of models for studying energy as a scarce resource from the point of view of the second law of thermodynamics and for attaching an economic value (a price) to energy in different qualities. It is shown that energy (potential amount of work extractable from a system of sources) acts both as a physical and as an economic norm.

This is a style of programming in which entire relations are manipulated rather than individual data, and in which the program itself is represented as a relation. Thus relational programming is more general than functional programming in three respects. First, it is more general because relations subsume functions. Second, it is more general because the same objects, viz. relations are used to represent both the program and the data. Finally, since complex data structures are easily represented as relations, relational programming can manipulate with facility a much wider class of structures that other very-high-level languages.

This paper presents the experience on an ongoing security kernel implementation using the Advanced Micro Devices 4116 single-board computer based on the Z8002 microprocessor. The performance issues of process switching, domain changing, and multiprocessor bus contention are explicitly addressed. The strictly hierarchical (i.e., loop-free) structure provides a series of increasingly capable, separately usable operating system subsets. Security enforcement is structured in two layers: the basic kernel rigorously enforces a non-discretionary (viz., lattice model) policy, while an upper layer provides the access refinements for a discretionary policy.

On some occasions, a signal may not be detected by any of the receivers. Using detection data collected from all the receivers over a period of scanning, it is possible to estimate the total number of signals that occurred in that period (including those that were not detected at all), as well as the detection probabilities for the individual receivers. Several estimators for these quantities are developed, in the contexts of several models concerning the signal generation process and the receiver behavior.

Specifically, we studied the current management practices in such areas as life cycle approach, project management, organization/management structure, and training provided to services acquisition personnel.  We find that the majority of the services contracts awarded and administered conformed to our expectation. For example, most service contracts are competitively bid, fixed-priced awards without any type of contract incentive. However, we found that the Air Force and Navy use different contracting approaches--pecifically in the areas of organizational level of acquisition offices (regional versus installation), the use of project teams, leaders of the acquisition effort (program personnel versus contracting officers), and managers of the services requirement (program personnel, contracting officers, and customer organizations). We analyzed the implications and impact of different approaches on the effectiveness of the contract management process and make recommendations on improving the management of services acquisition in the Department of Defense.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,00|aProgram management., 0|aProject management.,,,,"1 |aApte, Uday M.;1 |aRendon, Rene G.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-GSBPP-09-009|z(164 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA510366,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The framework will expand the information contained in the current metadata, to enable improved search and discovery capabilities and facilitate use of the repository items once they are retrieved. This paper lays the foundation for the research, by providing a characterization of the problem domain by describing the SHARE repository, its contents and its unique attributes. Based on this investigation, we then provide specific recommendations for both near term and long term improvements.  The near term suggestions are essentially ""low hanging fruit"", or ideas for quick improvements that can be implemented in a relatively short time frame.

It is an extension of previous work that established that Transaction Cost Economics has promising explanatory power in terms of costs of major DoD acquisition programs. The current work explores methods of measuring transaction costs as a first step in improving estimation methods by including explanatory variables that capture the coordination and motivation problems associated with a program. The preliminary results indicate that it is possible to measure contractor Systems Engineering/Program Management (SEPM) costs as a proxy for transaction costs. The ratio of SEPM to total costs was examined for two case studies (Javelin and ATACMS) for which ex-ante indicators of transaction costs had been assessed. The results are consistent in that the program with ex-ante indicators that indicated higher transaction costs also had a significantly higher SEPM ratio. Further research is required to better establish the relationship between transaction costs indicators and the quality of DoD cost estimates.,  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 11/20/09,,,,,,,,,"1 |aAngelis, Diana.;1 |aDillard, J.|q(John);1 |aFranck, Chip.;1 |aMelese, Francois.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-GSBPP-09-002.pdf|z(124 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The increasing emphasis on joint service and system-of-systems (SoS) capabilities has created both opportunities and challenges for materiel acquisition. A key barrier that needs to be overcome for the DoD to achieve the promises of joint service and SoS programs involves the challenge of ""transaction costs."" These are the less visible, but nonetheless significant, costs of negotiating, managing and monitoring transactions. In an effort to identify the effect of transaction costs on more complex acquisition programs, this paper examines cost and schedule breaches in a subset of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) that includes a sample of 84 programs, divided into ""joint service"" and ""traditional"" (single service) acquisition programs, and ""single  system"" and ""system-of-systems"" (SoS) programs. The results suggest there is a statistically significant higher risk of cost and schedule breaches in SoS programs than in single system acquisition programs. This paper contributes to a broader study that eventually needs to  be conducted that will evaluate the benefits and costs of increased reliance on joint service and SoS programs.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 11/20/09,,,,, 0|aTransaction costs.,,,,"1 |aAngelis , Diana.;1 |aDillard, J.|q(John);1 |aFranck, Raymond.;1 |aMelese, Francois.;1 |aBrown, Mary Maureen.;1 |aFlowe, Robert M.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-GSBPP-09-012.pdf|z(182.54 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Among other things, defense industrial affairs are becoming increasingly global and increasingly complex.  In this discussion, we focus more on defense firms--considering the organization of Boeing 787 development and production, the KC-45 aerial tanker competition, and European defense firms' direct investment in the US defense market. In the 787 case, we observe that even experienced companies such as Boeing can run afoul of the complexities of coordinating a multiform venture.  The KC-45, at least so far, seems to illustrate a new weakness of defense establishments relative to their suppliers. It is reasonable to suppose the two rival bidders (NG-EADS and Boeing) will continue to have veto powers over source selection--absent some fresh thinking.  European defense firms' (BAE, EADS and Finmeccanica) entry into the US defense market through various direct investment strategies results from an increasingly globalized defense market. More importantly, perhaps, it demonstrates their ability to work around obstacles posed by US legislative and regulatory barriers.  One major theme is that increased complexity of agile suppliers' methods and relationships poses significant problems for their bureaucratic customers.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 12/9/09,,,,," 0|aInvestments, Foreign.",,,,"1 |aFranck, Chip.;1 |aLewis, Ira A.;1 |aUdis, Bernard.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-GSBPP-09-004.pdf|z(1.6 MB);  |uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA510365,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

By tracing functions to systems, gaps were identified which created a foundation to investigate whether systems currently in development were available to meet theses gaps. In some cases, candidate C4I systems were proposed to fill gaps. System functionally overlap was also noted. As a by-product of our research into the MOC concept and analysis of it's required functions and candidate component systems, we have proposed a methodology for future work in the design of the MOC architecture.

For a sea  base to be truly beneficial a capability must exist that supports efficiently transporting needed materiel from the  sea base to the desired debarkation point. The capability must support peace-time, non-combat operations' and  war-time, combat operations' logistics and support needs. The solution must be cost effective and capable of  operating under all environmental conditions, including sea states, under which necessary military operations are  expected to take place and must support a transport rate sufficient to ensure materiel is delivered within  operational time requirements.

This threat could greatly impact the current  concept of operations of U.S. Navy ships and alter national defense policies. While current ballistic missile  defense solutions are capable of intercepting threats in midcourse and terminal flight phases, no comprehensive  system has been developed to counter a ballistic missile threat that can (1) maneuver upon reentry in the  endoatmosphere and (2) be used to attack a moving defended area, such as a U.S. Navy carrier strike group (CSG).

Prior studies analyzing the retention effect of the Navy's TA program have produced conflicting results-one  study finding that participants are more likely to leave the Navy, the other study finding they are more likely to stay. Our analysis of this  relationship has several advantages over the prior studies. First, the analysis exploits a unique feature in the data to create a natural control  group that allows us to adjust for the potential selection bias. Second, we use a larger data set consisting of cohorts of recruits who entered  the Navy between 1994 and 2001. The recruits are tracked during their first five years of service. We find that first term sailors who use TA  to enroll in college classes have a significantly higher probability of reenlistment and of promotion to both E4 and to E5 than those who  participate but do not complete their courses. While these results are robust to the controls for selection, the results indicate that selfselection  into the program is likely to explain as much as one-half of the baseline retention effect.

The study relied on a variety of analytical techniques, including a literature review of CBT and OJT training,  interviews and focus groups with junior and senior surface warfare officers, and statistical analysis of test scores at the Surface Officer  Division Officer Course (SWOSDOC). The literature review pointed out that no previous studies had analyzed a learning course that  involved CBT when the student was also performing a full-time job. Nonetheless, the literature review noted that structured OJT is  preferred to unstructured OJT, as in SWOS-at-Sea. Interviews also indicated that division officers prefer face-to-face learning and they felt  they were trying to perform as division officers without the requisite skills. The statistical analysis of test scores at the SWOSDOC 'leveling'  course found significant differences in performance between ship type, ship home port location, commissioning source, undergraduate  major, and gender.

The requirement to process, store and interpolate information and signals faster and with compact electronic units has led to the engineering of high power electronics. As the power density of these electronic systems increases, the demand for cooling increases. Development of directed energy systems also requires the dissipation of large heat loads. If the heat generated by high power electronics and other high energy systems is not reduced or transferred efficiently and quickly, resultant pre-mature equipment failure, individual component failure or the inability to operate the equipment will occur.    Carbon nanotube enhanced fluids have shown increases in the thermal conductivity from 20% to 250% when compared to the base heat transfer fluid. This study focuses on the stability of static, water-based, carbon nanotube enhanced mixtures during thermal cycling (i.e., freezing and thawing) of the nanofluid using various types of carbon nanotubes, loading percentages and surfactants. Electrical resistance measurements were recorded over a series of phase changes in order to assess the stability of the nanofluid.    Experimental results showed that static, carbon nanotube enhanced nanofluids are stable between three to five freeze and thaw cycles before the carbon nanotubes start to agglomerate and subside. This resulted in an increased electric conductivity, and validated the use of electrical resistance measurements as a viable means of assessing the stability of the nanofluid. However, ultrasonication of the nanofluids after the instability recovers the original electric conductivity of the nanofluid.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |atjc original 1/28/2010.,,,,, 0|aNanotechnology.; 0|aElectronics.,,,,"1 |aKwon, Young W.;1 |aPollak, Randall D.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-MAE-10-001.pdf|z(1.02 MB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Through the use of scenarios, it is intended to support education, training and awareness in cyber security. Naval Postgraduate School (NPS)  plans to use the game to help to teach Identity Management concepts. To help prepare for that, we conducted a study of barriers to engagement in CyberCIEGE by observing eight students while playing the game, analyzing game logs and holding evaluation meetings with two classes.  Our study revealed several barriers to becoming engaged in the game due to weaknesses in the game's user interface, the students' limited understanding of the security context and their limited video game playing skills. These problems can be mitigated by structuring game scenarios so that students must pass the beginners' level before advancing to subsequent levels. Optimally, a skilled student should be allowed to skip the simple introductions; however, it is not clear that student skill can be reliably assessed prior to playing the scenarios. Also, the CyberCIEGE Tire Ply Scenario should be improved to provide unambiguous objectives, timely and clear feedback and more relevant real life narratives.",  |aAlso available in print.,,"  |aFunding numbers: MIPR8JBIOM0075, MIPR8JBIOM0112.",  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |atjc original 1/28/2010.,,,,00|aSimulation., 0|aVideo games.; 0|aEducation.,,,,"1 |aIrvine, Cynthia E.;1 |aThompson, Michael F.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-CS-09-006.pdf|(534.48 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Both carbon fiber and E-glass fiber composites were manufactured with vinyl ester resin using vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding. First, the effects of single-step curing (i.e., co-curing) versus two-step curing (i.e., curing a new section to a previously cured section) was studied using Mode II fracture testing. The results showed the two-step cured interface was as strong as the co-cured interface, thus validating the use of two-step curing during modular construction or repair of composite sections. Application of carbon nanotubes to the composite interfaces was then accomplished through two-step curing, using acetone as a dispersant. Mode II testing indicated significant improvement of the interface fracture toughness for both carbon fiber and glass fiber samples with carbon nanotubes. Because carbon nanotubes have very high electrical conductivity, the electrical resistance was measured across the interface during Mode II loading. As the interface crack grew, there was an increase in electrical resistance (approximately linear for carbon fiber specimens until final failure). The study demonstrated the feasibility of electrical resistance measurement with dispersed carbon nanotubes to monitor damage along critical interfaces, while simultaneously improving fracture properties.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,  |aUS Navy (USN) author.,,  |arb/rb original 3/22/10.,,,,, 0|aStructural health monitoring.,,,,"1 |aKwon, Young W.;1 |aPollak, Randall D.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,40|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-MAE-10-003.pdf,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The end goal is to be able to use the survey to identify ""at risk"" U.S. Naval squadrons prior to the occurrence of mishaps. Safety climate describes employees' perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about risk and safety (Mearns & Flin, 1999). Safety climate is most commonly evaluated using questionnaires. Although assessments of safety climate are not widespread in civil aviation, the United States Navy has been using the CSAS since 2000 to measure the safety climate of aviation squadrons. This review argues that a comprehensive assessment of the construct (the extent to which the questionnaire measures what it is intended to measure) and discriminate validity (correlate the data from the questionnaire with a criterion variable, such as accidents) of the CSAS should be carried out.

While the ADM provided an impetus for commonality, it did not define a path. This project defines a common GCS functional architecture that provides the first steps on the path to UAS commonality. Stakeholder documentation was analyzed to identify areas of greatest concern and to examine previous efforts in this domain. Then, a tailored systems engineering process was employed to develop a new set of requirements which includes a common Air Vehicle Operator (AVO) Human-Machine Interface. These requirements enabled the creation of an innovative functional architecture for a common GCS concept.

Because of increased challenges related to complexity, cost, and timing, our engineering approach focused on finding failure modes early and implementing effective countermeasures. Following requirements analysis and identification of needed functions, the project team synthesized candidate solutions that introduced new concepts and also exploited known programs of record within the Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Marine Corps. These included Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), the aerostat Multi-Function Phased Array Radar, automation, and a Remote Sea Station.

In an attempt to develop a system of systems to defeat and prevent terrorism in the Straits of Malacca, this study  developed three significant commercial shipping attack scenarios (Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) shipment,  Ship As a Weapon (SAW), and Small Boat Attack (SBA)), and used a Systems Engineering Design Process (SEDP) to design  alternative architectures that offered promising ways to defeat these attacks. Maritime Domain Protection (MDP) architecture  alternatives combined five separate systems: a Land Inspection System, a Sensor System, a Command and Control,  Communications, and Intelligence (C3I) System, a Response Force System, and a Sea Inspection System. Individual models  for each system were developed and combined into overarching integrated architecture models to evaluate overall performance.  The study results showed that solutions tended to be threat-specific, and current capabilities were mixed. While solutions were  found to effectively reduce risk in all threat scenarios, these sometimes came at great expense. Alternatively, cost-effective  solutions were also found for each scenario, but these sometimes gave limited performance.",,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat Reader.,,  |aUS Navy (USN) authors.;  |aSingapore Defence Science and Technology Agency authors (civilian).;  |aTurkish Army authors.;  |aUS Army (USA) author.;  |aDepartment of Defense authors (civilian).,,  |aymk.oclc. orginal 4/12/2010,,,,, 0|aPiracy.; 0|aShipping.; 0|aSystems engineering.,,,,"1 |aBuschmann, Jeff.;1 |aCrider, Tracey.;1 |aFerraris, Guillermo.;1 |aGarcia, Enrique.;1 |aGungor, Hasan.;1 |aHoffmann, Shannon.;1 |aKelley, Micah.;1 |aMacCumbee, Cory,;1 |aMalloch, Robert.;1 |aMcCarthy, Chris.;1 |aMcIlvaine, Jacob.;1 |aRummler, David.;1 |aSari, Serdar.;1 |aTeo, Tiong Ngee.;1 |aWalton, David.;1 |aWestmoreland, William.;1 |aWiens, Matt.;1 |aWise, Alexis.;1 |aWoelfel, Greg.;1 |aWyllie, Russ.;1 |aAng, Han Hiong.;1 |aCheng, Kok Meng.;1 |aChua, Chay.;1 |aCfir, Dolev.;1 |aEr, Kim Hua.;1 |aHow, Yew Seng.;1 |aHsu, Yu Chih.;1 |aKhoo, Wee Tuan.;1 |aKoh, Swee Jin.;1 |aKratzer, Rick;1 |aLiang, Lawrence.;1 |aLim, Joel.;1 |aLim, Tat Lee.;1 |aLorio, Jennifer.;1 |aLukacs, John.;1 |aNg, Chee Mun.;1 |aOng, Winston.;1 |aQuek, Chin Khoon.;1 |aRaghavan, Dinesh.;1 |aTan, Mark.;1 |aTan, Nai Kwan.;1 |aTeo, Amos.;1 |aTeo, Hong-Siang.;1 |aTong, Matthew.;1 |aYeoh, Keat Hoe.;1 |aYong, Yoke Chuang.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bWayne E.

Because of increased challenges related to complexity, cost, and timing, our engineering approach focused on finding failure modes early and implementing effective countermeasures. Following requirements analysis and identification of needed functions, the project team synthesized candidate solutions that introduced new concepts and also exploited known programs of record within the Navy, the Coast Guard, and the Marine Corps. These included Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), the aerostat Multi-Function Phased Array Radar, automation, and a Remote Sea Station.

A general model for traffic adaptive, flow-specific medium access control is developed and it is shown that hybrid medium access as well as traditional contention-based and non-contention schemes can be seen as special cases of the more general flow-specific access. The two flow, two-mode case of the general model is developed in detail and it is shown analytically that this queue-based implementation of traffic-adaptive, flow-specific medium access outperforms contention, non-contention, and hybrid  approaches. The proposed traffic-adaptive, flow-specific mechanism is applied to Cooperative Wireless Sensor Network Medium Access Control (CWS-MAC) a flow-specific medium access protocol.

The objections from Congress center on  government's surrender of too much of its responsibility, authority, and budget to private industry. As a result of the concern over the use of  LSIs, program managers are understandably interested in minimizing risk to better control costs, schedule, and performance. In order to  minimize risk, it is essential that contracts are written well, with appropriate specificity, and include not only the desired goods or services,  but also essential information that enables the program manager to track the progress of contract performance and to quickly detect  potential problems.

Designed to improve acquisition outcomes, the ""Economic Evaluation of Alternatives"" (EEoA) addresses a significant weakness in most contemporary military applications of the current methodology--the Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs). While AoAs correctly focus on lifecycle costs and the operational effectiveness of alternatives, ""affordability"" is an after-thought--at best only implicitly addressed as a weight placed on cost in  the final stages of the analysis. In sharp contrast, the EEoA encourages senior analysts and decision-makers to include affordability explicitly and up-front in structuring an AoA. This requires working with vendors to build alternatives based on a reasonable spectrum of possible funding (budget or affordability) scenarios. A key difference between traditional AoAs and the EEoA approach is that instead of modeling competing vendors as points in cost-effectiveness space, the EEoA solicits vendor proposals as functions of optimistic, pessimistic, and most-likely funding (budget) scenarios. The Decision Map offered in the concluding section of this study provides a comprehensive guide to EEoA for practitioners. This study also illustrates how, by embedding affordability directly into an AoA, the EEoA  approach provides a unique opportunity for senior leadership to achieve a significant defense acquisition reform--to integrate Requirements Generation and Defense Acquisition with the Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS), reducing future costs and improving performance and schedules.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adaw/ original 5/3/10,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-GSBPP-10-002.pdf|z(360 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Research showed that the lack of structure associated with the  vendor-provided Technical Review Package (TRP) led to inconsistent documentation and standards in the SSSTRP process of evaluating  the vendor's software safety risk. The development of a domain-specific Requirements Framework designed to work with the SSSTRP  process will both help the vendor fully understand the measurable requirements for the TRP, and the SSSTRP members to understand the measurable standard by which the TRP is evaluated.

However, we first discuss recent GAO criticism of profits received on Award Fee contracts and the response by DoD and other organizations. Next, the general policy guidelines established in 1969 by DoD and NASA that are still in effect are reviewed, as are the recommendations made by academic economists beginning in the 1970s. We also discuss the recent introduction of System Design Specifications. While these specifications contain a great deal of information that can be used when developing Performance Incentives and Award Fees, this new policy represents a movement away from performance specifications and may constrain a contractor's ability to make trade-off decisions. The broad conclusion of this analysis is that the intuition obtained from the 1969 DoD and NASA Guide might be combined with  that of economists when properly structuring incentive contracts.

The first part compares the performance of several nonlinear filtering algorithms in tracking a single target: the extended Kalman filter (EKF); the unscented Kalman filter (UKF); the particle filter (PF); and the particle filter with UFK update (UPF).  Measurements are range, azimuth and elevation.  In the absence of measurement error, all algorithms work well except for the PF, which does not converge.  With measurement noise (standard deviations of 10 meters and 1 degree) the EFK also performs poorly, while the UPF is the top performer (although it is also the most computationally intensive).

The software was already verified and validated using a comparable air bearing test-bed. But due to changes in hardware from commercial magnetic torque rods to custom, NPS-built, magnetic torque coils, the changes in the modulated software have to be verified again. Additionally, the use of flight hardware on the test-bed is expanded to also verify and validate the currently available flight hardware. NPSAT1 is a passive, gravity-gradient stabilized satellite. This thesis shows the necessary fundamental requirements on the satellite's mass properties, which has to be met to realize a gravity-gradient stabilized satellite, as well as the basics of pendulum theory, which is required to set up the test-bed on the air bearing for testing. This thesis describes the measurement of the earth's magnetic field taken in the SSAG laboratory and the resulting magnetic field vector field. Restrictions dictatd by the air bearing are followed by a chapter that summarizes and explains all requirements on the new test-bed design. A detailed description of the chosen design approach, layout and available test-bed configurations is given, as well as issues encountered and their solutions.The next step is to verify the ACS MATLAB/SimuLinkª attitude control algorithm and to validate the MATLAB/SimuLinkª model using the designed air bearing test-bed. Further, it is suggested to proceed the verification and validiation of NPSAT1's behavior in space by using the custom, NPS-built, Helmholtz coils. With the assistance of Helmholtz coils, custom magnetic field properties can be generated.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adk/ original 5/12/10,,,,,,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-SP-10-001.pdf|z(8.25 MB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The squad leader is the cornerstone for USMC tactical operations. Clear, concise, accurate and reliable communications to and from the squad leader is the key to squad operations, performance and tactical effectiveness. Today's fielded communications system for the squad leader requires the use of two separate radios, each with different encryption algorithms, different user interfaces, and different data processing capabilities. This primitive design has thrust the squad leader into a complex Human Factors environment with disparate components that have not been well engineered or integrated.  Team Marine applied and tailored the systems engineering (SE) process based on NPS course work and professional experience. This SE process enabled the team to completely understand and model the current system in terms of architecture, capabilities and functions. The process led the team and stakeholders to conclude that an evolutionary approach of system integration was preferred over the traditional Manufacturer A vs. Manufacturer B run off.  The team's recommendation is to pursue an integrated communications system, based on existing and emerging components, as the best course of action. The first incremental step of the recommendation is to upgrade the existing elements by adding an automated communications processor with enhanced human to system interfaces.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,  |adaw/ original 5/21/10,,10|aUnited States.|bMarine Corps.,,, 0|aCommunication.; 0|aSystems integration.; 0|aSystems engineering.; 0|aCryptography.; 0|aArchitecture.,,,,"1 |aAmin, Kruna.;1 |aDixon, Jeffrey.;1 |aHunt, Kathryn.;1 |aManternach, Peter.;1 |aRoach, Brenda.;1 |aBochenek, Larry.;1 |aElgart, Richard.;1 |aJeleniewski, Yancy.;1 |aReap, Jonathan.;1 |aSong, Brian.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bMarine Corps Systems Command.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2009/NPS-SE-09-007.pdf|z(2 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA513783,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Second, the technique includes a computer aided approach for validating the correctness of requirements early in the development process, allowing sufficient time for the correction of ambiguous and underspecified requirements. In the verification phase the technique is based on off-line verification using log-files.

Although prior studies  have investigated the effect of completing college courses via TA on enlisted retention and promotion (Mehay and Pema, 2009), no prior study  has examined the effect of the instructional methods in the courses taken via TA. Interest in course delivery methods has been stimulated by the  rapid growth in online TA classes. This study analyzes the effects of completing TA-supported college courses on promotion and retention, and  whether the mode of instruction in the courses is important. We also analyze how student learning and course completion varies by mode of  instruction. Our analyses recognize the potential biases that arise from self-selection of students into courses, and we statistically adjust for  individual heterogeneity in estimates of the impact of online and traditional classes. We find that completion rates and student grades are lower  in online classes than in traditional classes. Overall, reenlistment rates are higher for those who complete their TA classes, versus those who fail  or withdraw from their classes. However, reenlistment effects are greater for TA students who pass online courses than for those who pass  traditional classes.

Discrepancies which arose between the newly constructed charts and the original listings are highlighted. A conclusion of this study is that rather than improving clarity, applying structured documentation to non-structured programs may result in the opposite effect--incomplete, inconsistent, and ambiguous documentation--because a hierarchical format cannot adequately represent a non-hierarchical program.",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 4/15/09.;  |aGutted record reput. 12/04/97. dln.

The level of autonomous behavior correlates to: 1) the amount of trust with  the reporting vehicles, and 2) the multi-spectral perspective of the observations.  The intent to illuminate the architectural issues for force protection in 2030 was based on a multi-phased  analytical model of High Value Unit (HVU) defense. The results showed that autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles  are required to defeat high-speed incoming missiles.  To evaluate the level of autonomous behavior required for an integrated combat architecture, geometric  distributions were modeled to determine force positioning, based on a scenario driven Detect-to-Engage timeline.  Discrete event simulation was used to schedule operations, and a datalink budget assessment of communications to  determine the critical failure paths in the the integrated combat architecture.  The command and control principles used in the integrated combat architecture were based on Boyd's  OODA (Obseve, Orient, Decide, and Act) Loop.

This is the first evidence of this.  2) Beam direction is consistent despite several elements being present within the sound transmission system within the dolphin's forehead. This  suggests that the skull is the primary structural element in the formation of the sound transmission beam, with other elements playing a major role  in concentrating or ""focusing"" the outgoing beam.  3) There is evidence for focusing of the beam in stages. The model simulations illustrate the narrowing of the sound transmission beam with  various level of refinement in structural complexity. It appears as if structures like the melon and air space individually affect the narrowing of  the beam, with their combined contributions being significant.

A higher degree of openness both supports weapon system programs in terms of competition for development and support, as well as  facilitates rapid technology insertion.

It has seen practical application in the Defense Department within the Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (FAST). At present, given a personnel duty schedule with work and sleep periods, it is possible to obtain future predicted task effectiveness using FAST. It is not possible, however, to directly address the inverse question: given a task effectiveness threshold, what is the optimal schedule in terms of the time of sleep-wake periods and the assignment of performance sensitive duties? Such questions can now be addressed by importing data generated from FAST simulations into the Task Effectiveness Scheduling Tool (TEST). TEST is a mixed integer program that assigns persons to wake-sleep cycles and variable duty periods to provide coverage of a system function using the minimum quantity of personnel, while simultaneously ensuring individuals exceed a specified task effectiveness criterion during duty periods. The program then ensures that the temporal scheduling of duty periods maximizes averaged predicted task effectiveness over a 24-hour period.

Incorporating benefits into AoA is particularly difficult because of the intangible nature of many important benefits. The current  work addresses the need to improve the use of benefits in AoA by building a system dynamics model of a military operation and integrating  it with the Knowledge Value Added (KVA) methodology. The synergies may be able to significantly improve the accuracy of KVA estimates  in the AoA process. A notional mobile weapon system was modeled and calibrated to reflect four weaponized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  (UAV). Modeling a hypothetical AoA for upgrading one of the UAV indicated that there were potentially significant synergies that could  increase the number of alternatives that could be analyzed, establishing common units of benefit estimates for an AoA, improved reliability  of an AoA, and improved justification of AoA results.

The objectives of the ICC research program are (1) to understand the success factors that lead to and the barriers that interfere with ICC; (2) to construct diagnostic methods and tools to assess these factors; and (3) to develop methods that contribute to the development of ICC in and among agencies and organizations.  The research literature indicates that a major barrier blocking progress in understanding ICC is the absence of reliable, valid measures for the construct. This study addresses this problem. It presents the results of ICC scale development using samples of public sector, defense and security professionals from two areas: Homeland Defense and Security and Defense Acquisition and Contracting. The research presents scales that have very good to excellent internal consistency reliability and convergent validity.

This places particular importance on understanding the dynamics of knowledge as it flows from where and when it is to where and when it is needed. Given the increasingly strategic importance of computer networks in terms of achieving, defending and ultimately sustaining competitive advantage, understanding how to manage dynamic knowledge through Cyberspace has become critical to organizational survival. Unfortunately, considerable confusion and uncertainty regarding Cyberspace knowledge management (CyberKM) abound and persist, rendering pursuits of sustainable competitive advantage daunting at best and infeasible in many cases. The research described in this paper builds upon Knowledge Flow Theory to illustrate a scheme for measuring dynamic knowledge flows in the cyber domain. Through this novel approach to measurement, one can analyze and visualize the relative power, speed and proliferation of both tacit and explicit knowledge through organizations, which enables knowledge leaders, managers and workers to understand the comparative costs and benefits of alternate approaches to and technologies for managing cyber knowledge. This work articulates a clear set of tradeoffs facing decision makers in Cyberspace, and it provides principles-based techniques for making cyber knowledge decisions in a rational and informed manner. Hence we offer a theoretical contribution suitable for academic journals, but we highlight in particular current, practical application through enhanced decision making in the context of harnessing dynamic knowledge for sustainable competitive advantage through Cyberspace.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aCyberspace.; 0|aDynamics.; 0|aKnowledge management.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-IS-10-006.pdf|z(370.89 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The quasi-experimental study design compared Soldiers assigned to one of two training companies: a company using the standard BCT sleep regimen (8:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m.) or a company using a phase-delayed sleep regimen (11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.), the latter being more in line with the biologically driven sleep-wake patterns of adolescents. Demographic and psychophysiological measures were collected at the start of the study using standard survey instruments and methods. A random sample of approximately 24% of Soldiers wore wrist activity monitors to unobtrusively record sleep quantity and quality. Weekly assessments were made of subjective fatigue and mood throughout BCT. Data on physical fitness, marksmanship, and attrition from BCT were extracted from organizational training records.  The study sample was comprised of 392 Soldiers, 209 in the intervention group and 183 in the comparison group. Based on actigraphic data, it was shown that Soldiers on the modified sleep schedule obtained 33 more minutes of total sleep per night than those on the standard sleep schedule. Soldiers in the intervention group reported less total mood disturbance relative to baseline, but the effect size was modest and diminished over the course of BCT. Improvements in Soldier marksmanship performance over a series of record fires was positively correlated with average nightly sleep during the week preceding the record fires, when basic marksmanship tasks were being learned. By the end of BCT, Soldiers in the comparison group were 2.3 times more likely to have occupationally significant fatigue and were 5.5 times more likely to report poor sleep quality, as assessed using validated survey instruments, than those in the comparison group. There was no effect of the sleep scheduling intervention on physical fitness scores or the relative risk for attrition. Overall, increasing sleep and concomitantly decreasing fatigue had a small but measurable influence on various indicators of Soldier functioning even after controlling for a variety of factors that affect performance.",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aContract number: W911NF-07-2-0062.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aBiological rhythms.; 0|aShooting.; 0|aMilitary education.; 0|aOperations research.; 0|aPsychology.; 0|aPhysiology.; 0|aSleep.,,,,"1 |aMiller, Nita Lewis.;1 |aShattuck, Lawrence G.;1 |aTvaryanas, Anthony P.;1 |aMatsangas, Panagiotis.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-OR-10-011.pdf|z(1.64 MB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Utilizing a combination of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, we were unable to identify a stable factor structure from the CSAS data. We believe that this finding was because of the effect of the nonconstant variance of the data, which was due to the large proportion of participants using a satsificing strategy (respondents interpret each question superficially and select what they believe to be a reasonable answer). Fortunately, since 2006, the amount of time taken by respondents to complete the survey was collected. This ""time to complete"" data was then used as a metric to identify the respondents utilizing an optimizing strategy (respondents generating the optimum answer). A total of 2,344 responses were retained for analysis. We also elected to discard the CSAS items that had low variability. Using the truncated dataset, we carried out an exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and were able to establish a stable, 12-item, two-factor (named personnel leadership, and integration of safety and operations) model.

The Dialogue is a track 1.5 conference; thus, it is formally unofficial, but includes a mix of government and academic participants. The Dialogue is organized by the Naval Postgraduate School and Pacific Forum-CSIS and is funded and guided by the Advanced Systems and Concepts Office of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction Agency.  The goal of this series of annual meetings has been to identify important misperceptions regarding each side's nuclear strategy and doctrine and highlight potential areas of cooperation or confidence building measures that might reduce such dangers. Beyond that, the conference aims to deepen American understandings of the way China views nuclear weapons, the domestic debates that shape those views, and the degree to which there is change in strategy, doctrine, and force posture in Beijing. The previous four meetings have focused their discussions on general perceptions of the utility of nuclear weapons, the nature of current nuclear strategy and operational concepts of each side, regional issues pertaining to nuclear weapons issues, and prospects for cooperation with regard to specific policy areas.  This year, the meeting was organized around six panels (see the attached agenda) centering on the key strategic threat perceptions of each side--general and proliferation related--and the various sorts of security policies each undertakes to address these threats--unilateral, bilateral, or multilateral.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aNuclear weapons., 0|aChina.,,,"1 |aTwomey, Christopher.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bDefense Threat Reduction Agency.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-NS-10-002.pdf|z(349.19 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The purpose of the NTSOD rating system is to provide a framework for evaluating the nontechnical skills of U.S. Navy Surface Warfare Officers of the Deck (OOD). Nontechnical skills are the cognitive, social, and personal skills that complement technical skills. The NTSOD system supplements the current OOD qualification process by providing an objective and documented assessment of the nontechnical skills of OOD candidates. The NTSOD system consists of four categories of behavior (leadership, communication, situational awareness, and decision making), which are subdivided into 10 more specific, and observable, elements of behavior. The framework was developed through the analysis of data collected from qualified OODs. When properly utilized, the authors believe that the NTSOD system can produce skilled OODs, and increase the overall safety of the surface fleet by providing feedback on a crucial aspect of OOD performance that is not consistently evaluated across the Surface Fleet.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,,,,,,"1 |aO'Connor, Paul E.;1 |aMcCauley, Michael E.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-OR-10-009.pdf|z(102.12 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

As configurations change and OA  software is put in new environments, the potential for finding or creating new bugs increases. The concept of using an operational profile, or environment model that generates inputs to an OA software module, based on probabilistic distributions, to assist in the automated testing process is critical for catching such bugs.

This is accomplished by developing the requirements for an alternative fuel, analyzing several potential candidates, and recommending a preferred alternative (Fischer-Tropsch S-5). Additionally, this report describes the existing infrastructure supporting fuel distribution to Navy ships and explores options for changes necessary to support the selected alternative fuel. A notional mission profile is depicted, showing the Green Strike Group's progress from Norfolk, Virginia to the Arabian Sea and back again over the course of a 180-day deployment. A deterministic fuel estimation model and the succeeding, higher fidelity stochastic model are described, leading to the prediction of alternative fuel amount requirements and necessary geographic placement. Finally, this report concludes with the assertion that while sailing the Green Strike Group is technologically possible, significant and immediate economic investments are needed in order to realize the Secretary of the Navy's goal by 2016.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aFuel switching.; 0|aSystems engineering.; 0|aFischer-Tropsch process.,,,,"1 |aArmstrong, Lincoln.;1 |aKelly, Mary.;1 |aNester, Amie.;1 |aSchindler, Theodore.;1 |aYoung, Michael.;1 |aColon, John.;1 |aKing, Joseph.;1 |aParr, Jennifer.;1 |aSmall, Kenneth.;1 |aFinch, Chad.;1 |aMcCreary, James.;1 |aRodecap, Nathan.;1 |aSunshine, Nicholus.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-SE-10-007.pdf|z(6.92 MB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

It enjoys abundant empirical support and guides organizational  design and change across a broad diversity of contingencies, in terms of command and control as well as organization and management. Through  a combination of research and practice we understand how organizations are designed to fit their environments, technologies and other  contingencies individually as well as simultaneously. An emerging phenomenon is straining this understanding, however, as new organizations  are spawning wholly within virtual worlds. Here the organization and its environment exist solely within technological artifacts. This raises an  important organizational design question regarding the fit of such organizations with their virtual environments and corresponding technologies.  From one perspective, we can argue that virtual worlds are not important beyond recreation and game playing, that textbook principles of  Contingency Theory and organizational design apply to virtual worlds directly, and that our extant understanding of telework, electronic  commerce, network-centric operations, and virtual organization is sufficient. From an alternate perspective, many serious organizations are  emerging within such worlds, worlds which have few physical constraints. Also, advances in graphics technology and cinematic engagement  enable unparalleled levels of immersiveness that can induce sustained psychological engrossment in virtual worlds, along with time investments  and emotional commitments comparable to or exceeding those associated with physical organizations. As part of a continuing initiative on  command and control (C2) in virtual environments, the research described in this article takes neither perspective but uses Contingency Theory to  understand organization in virtual worlds. Through immersive and extensive ethnographic research within virtual worlds, intriguing new insights  into Contingency Theory and organizational design emerge, and we begin to outline a framework for understanding how and where C2 can be  enhanced through virtual world immersion.",  |aAlso available in print.,,"  |aContract number(s): DWAM90215, DWAM90947.",  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aOrganizational sociology.; 0|aTextbooks.; 0|aElectronic commerce.; 0|aRecreation.; 0|aVirtual reality.; 0|aEthnology.; 0|aEmergencies.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bDept. of Defense.|bOffice of the Secretary of Defense.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-IS-10-005.pdf|z(987.43 KB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA530793,  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Improvements to the DoN systems engineering processes were  developed to ensure that these requirements are identified and promulgated through key program documents and design reviews. There was a  down selection of alternatives that examined several candidate options for solutions. This down selection incorporated an evaluation of cost and benefits for each alternative. This included an assessment of how the requirements and testing of the system would have changed if this modified  review process had been performed. The current process is improved upon by introducing I/ORLs. These enhanced processes were simulated on a representative DoN system in a tabletop exercise to provide an example of how this modified process could be performed.

Acoustic techniques have become the primary tool used for this task, and have produced vast quantities of data. Automatic call detection software has rapidly become the method of choice for analyzing these data. Most methods for detecting and classifying animal sounds in marine science have been developed for low frequency sounds of baleen whales. However, it is odontocetes (especially beaked whales) that have been most affected by marine operations, particularly of the U. S. Navy, and are of greatest public concern. Therefore, development of high-performance automatic detection methods for odontocetes is now imperative. This report chronicles the progress of this project to collect recordings of beaked whales and other marine mammal species; to  annotate these sound files to make them useful to researchers working on automatic call detection and classification; to make the sound files publicly available in an archive on the Internet (""MobySound""); and to develop and test automatic detection algorithms and software, particularly software for autonomous ocean sensing systems such as gliders.",  |aAlso available in print.,,  |aContract number: N00244-08-1-0029.,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,00|aAcoustic archive., 0|aMarine mammals.; 0|aToothed whales.; 0|aBeaked whales.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-OC-10-005CR.pdf|z(302.29 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Participants were asked to simulate the common military task of road marching on a treadmill  while wearing a backpack. Load distribution was either high or low and gradient was either level (0%) or a positive  incline (11%). Methods used to assess the effects of load distribution and gradient on load carriage were Heart Rate  Variability, Regional Body Discomfort Diagram, questionnaires, and Rating of Perceived Exertion. An analysis of  each dependent variable: heart rate, Regional Body Discomfort Diagram, and Rating of Perceived Exertion, showed  that participants preferred the high backpack load condition and that they experienced more discomfort while walking  uphill. According to the questionnaire responses, participants felt the most discomfort on the shoulder and neck areas.

Nonetheless, we can bring to bear the rich armamentarium of Contingency Theory to help guide our inter-organizational design endeavors. A fundamental problem, however, stems from the predominate research focus on static fit, a focus that is incommensurate with the fundamentally dynamic nature of organizations and their environments. Most key organizational environments are inherently dynamic, hence the corresponding organizational designs required for fit are necessarily dynamic too. This problem grows even more severe in the context of inter-organizational design, particularly where the participating organizations comprising a collectivity come and go over time. Addressing in part some longstanding calls in the literature for more dynamic conceptualization of fit, a novel approach utilizes the dynamical language and integrated system of concepts, definitions and interrelationships from the engineering field Aerodynamics. This approach is broadly applicable, and it can help to elucidate organizational design and engineering issues even in the very complex context of inter-organizational collectivities. In this article, we begin with a focused summary of such dynamic fit conceptualization, and we illustrate its use through empirical application to a very complex inter-organizational case involving thousands of participating organizations attempting to provide multinational disaster relief.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aDisaster relief.; 0|aDynamics.; 0|aEngineering.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.). |bInformation Sciences Department.;1 |aUnited States.|bDept. of Defense.|bOffice of the Secretary of Defense.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2011/NPS-IS-11-001.pdf|z(265.79 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

The experiment used the C3Conflict war game to elicit and contrast measures of leader performance across two conditions that simulated alternative BOI for NW. C3Conflict is a distributed, computer-based, multiplayer, small unit war game designed to elicit measures of leader performance focusing on command, control, and communication. In the fully NW-enabled condition, the C3Conflict interface simulated the information and communication enabled by NW and made this package available to three soldiers---one in the role of Squad Leader (SL) and two in the role of Team Leader (TL). In contrast, in the partially NW-enabled condition, C3Conflict made that package available only to SL; the interface for the two TL simulated the limitations of line-of-sight vision. Eighteen hypotheses were tested. All predicted that unit performance would be better in the fully NW-enabled condition. Ten were confirmed. No measures showed superiority for the partially NW-enabled condition. These findings support the argument that the fully NW-enabled BOI improves squad-level communications, coordination, and maneuvers. In the discussion section, these results are interpreted to reveal that the fully-enabled BOI is the preferable option for two reasons.

The assessments were conducted using the Contract Management Maturity Model (CMMM) as the initial step in a program of contract management process improvement. The purpose of this research is to use these combined contract management process assessment results to characterize the current state of practice of contract management within the Department of Defense and defense organizations.

The team used Vitech's CORE Model Based Systems Engineering tool to model and simulate the baseline and hypothesized data paths and information processes derived from two mission threads: Counter-Piracy and Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief. Considerations for time-sensitive sensor data included key decisions on tasking, collection, processing, exploitation, fusion, analysis, and dissemination.  Modeling and simulation results show that Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs) at the OLW provides only a minor improvement to the overall performance of the NPP and a moderate improvement to the number of information requests the Maritime Intelligence Operations Center can fulfill.  The results are significant in that they appear to validate an Operational Commander's decision not to directly use UAS to support the OLW.

In the North Pacific, much of what is known about large whale seasonal occurrence comes from Sound Surveillance  System (SOSUS) arrays. SOSUS provides broad basin-scale assessments of large whale seasonal occurrence, but cannot provide detail at the  regional level, in particular here for the Navy's Northern Edge (Training) Range in the northern Gulf of Alaska. Here, data from long-term  acoustic observations of basin-wide data, and from a short-term, nearshore acoustic deployment in the NER, are presented.  For the long-term observations, Navy-analyst derived detections of blue and fin whales were compared with spectral data to determine if  there is a reliable way to separate the two species in the spectral data. Although the degree to which detections matched the spectra varied  with frequency range, generally blue and fin whale detections matched the spectra. However, when only blue, and no fin, whales (or vice  versa) were detected by analysts, there were no discernable differences in the spectral levels of different frequency ranges. This suggests that, absent other confirmation of the presence of blue and fin whale vocalizations, these species cannot be reliably discerned from spectra data  alone in regions and seasons where the two overlap.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aSOSUS.; 0|aBlue whale.; 0|aFinback whale.; 0|aMarine mammals.; 0|aCetacea.; 0|aToothed whales.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.);1 |aUnited States.|bOffice of the Chief of Naval Operations.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2010/NPS-OC-10-006CR.pdf|z(896.46 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Various alternatives were explored with the intent in making recommendations for technology investment by the U.S. Navy. Research conducted by the project team on industry analogues shows that financial industry also relies on network technology as well as operational architecture to effectively execute transactions valued at trillions of dollars daily on a global scale. Global banking systems employ a ""Clearing House"" approach that settles critical  transactions quickly and ""keeps track"" of all transactions. This allows Banks to quickly understand debits and credits and minimize liquidity risk.  Re-thinking conventional data management into a structure that address ""mission risk"" as key metric may allow alternative architectures to be employed for fleet battle management.

The Capstone team elicited launch and recovery system requirements from stakeholders and conceived four (4) advanced alternatives and a baseline alternative considered to meet the requirements. Through functional, cost, risk, modeling and qualitative analysis, this study assessed the value of each alternative to stakeholders. Of the concept alternatives explored, a high tech option featuring a carbon fiber structure, electromechanical pulse launch and recovery device and proximity vice contact battery charging and UUV stowage features provided the best value to the stakeholders for the investment. These results highlighted characteristics, including maintenance considerations, upgradeability, design for reliability and design for universal applications considered  paramount for a successful system.

The disaster in this project's scenario is catastrophic flooding that occurs in one of Africa's most populated and wealthiest countries that threatens the stability and development of West Africa. This project, employing a systems engineering methodology, focuses on the 60 days after the disaster and the requirements to provide this assistance in the form of goods and services. Many system-of-systems architectures were developed to investigate the effectiveness of utilizing a Seabase for the primary delivery of aid. Two simulation tools, SimKit, and STELLA, were used to model and examine these architectures with the former addressing the delivery and throughput concerns while the latter focused on the satisfaction of the population and the limitation of criminal activity.

This 52% reduction in manpower utilization will provide a more rested and effective crew, increasing safety of ship, while potentially saving the Navy $4 1.7 million per year.  One current thrust for the technical community within the United States Navy Submarine Force is how the technical community can sensibly implement Reduced Total Ownership Cost (RTOC) ensuring affordability of the next generation Submarine CCS. Since the submarine platforms play a significant role in the theater level engagement chain, the submarine combat system effectiveness cannot adversely impact the success of the overall theater level engagement chain.  A central theme of our research is to show the effects that lowering combat system manning has on the overall effectiveness of the submarine engagement chain.

Using a USC in selected missions could lead to cost reductions and enhanced capabilities when compared with similar manned combatants by eliminating  personnel and automating ship operations. Operations and Support (O&S) costs, which include personnel costs, are a large portion of the Navy's total  ownership costs (TOC) for surface combatants, and can be as high as 38 percent of the TOC. Enhanced capabilities for a USC could be derived from performing operational activities manned ships cannot; and automated tasks could be performed more efficiently and effectively by a computer system than a human. A modified waterfall systems engineering process model was used to explore a USC concept. A needs analysis was performed, and mine warfare and anti-submarine warfare were identified as appropriate military missions for an initial USC concept. Top level constraints for a USC concept and support missions were developed. Design considerations, relevant technologies, and concept risks were investigated. This capstone project concluded  that a lower cost, higher capability autonomous USC is possible based on the current state of relevant technologies. However there are significant technical challenges to overcome before full autonomy is possible.

To mitigate the cumulative effect of these stressors on their units and individuals, leaders and unit members must be able to assist one another to effectively cope under stressful conditions. We believe that resilience and coping strategies improve the effectiveness and sustainability for those in service. The central purpose of this project is to examine the factors of small unit organizational resilience. Assessments such as these intend to inform how leaders might build, foster, and sustain resiliency in their organizations. Resilience is defined as ""the capacity for adaptability, positive functioning, or competence following chronic stress or prolonged trauma"" (Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003, p. 96). Put simply, it allows an individual or organization to draw on internal and  external resources to positively adjust to current adversities and strengthens their ability to cope with future setbacks. We offer four core domains of resilience that units may use to assess their ability to deal with operational stress: concerted leadership, adequate resources, enhancement of organizational learning, and flexibility and adaptability in the face of adversity.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aSuicide|xPrevention.,,,,"1 |aLopes, John F.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.) |b Graduate School of Business and Public Policy.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2011/NPS-GSBPP-11-006.pdf|z(241.81 KB),  |aELECTRONIC RESOURCE|wASIS|c1|lELECTRONIC|rN|sY|tTECH RPT|xNPSPUB,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Meanwhile, rapidly maturing  technologies offer greater capabilities to potential adversaries around the world. Such a paradigm creates an imperative for the  Navy to harness emerging technologies to maintain USW dominance amid a dynamic threat environment, while balancing cost,  risk, and required performance. This systems engineering analysis develops Advanced Undersea Warfare Systems (AUWS) that  provide a technological and tactical advantage based on the needs of the war-fighter. Following critical analysis of the numerous  possible alternatives for performing the necessary Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance,  and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) and prosecution and an objective screening process, four system architectures, and associated  operational concepts, are selected for detailed analysis. From cost, risk, and performance analyses, superior AUWS concepts are  shown to be flexible, scalable, and tailorable systems that balance critical need areas. This analysis highlights the need for new  warfare systems that can meet future challenges to the traditional platform-centric model for USW dominance. Using the results  and recommendations in this analysis will allow the Navy to deploy capabilities that effectively and efficiently meet future  operational needs.",  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aComputers.; 0|aIntellect.,,,,"1 |aEmmersen, Tracy.;1 |aChuan, Ng Kiang.;1 |aChiam, David.;1 |aXuan, Ong Zi.;1 |aDaniel, Perh Hong Yih.;1 |aYung, Koh Wee.;1 |aWessner, Wes.;1 |aSaburn, Jon.;1 |aWee, Lim Choon.;1 |aHeng, Wong Chee.;1 |aSilvestrini, Christian.;1 |aLiang, Lu Zheng.;1 |aCastaneda, Phil.;1 |aLun, Sor Wei.;1 |aKok, Pek Wee.;1 |aDrennan, Jim.;1 |aKiong, Teo Yong.;1 |aFung, Tan Yick.;1 |aHarvey, Scott.;1 |aWalker, William.;1 |aChuan, Wee Hong.;1 |aMalinowski, Matt.;1 |aZhu, Kelvin.;1 |aMills, Thomas.;1 |aWei, Chang Chung.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.).|bDepartment of Systems Engineering.,,,,,,,41|uhttp://edocs.nps.edu/npspubs/scholarly/TR/2011/NPS-SE-11-004.pdf|z(6.48 MB);41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA544795,,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Particle size and mass concentrations were determined at the engine and stack exhausts using three wavelength optical detector systems. Particulate samples were also collected at the engine exhaust and analyzed with a scanning electron microscope. Combustor temperature and fuel additives were found to significantly affect particulate mass concentrations emitted from the engine while particle size appeared to be unaffected. No significant changes in the particulate size or mass occurred from the engine exhaust to the stack exhaust. The optical determination of exhaust mean particulate size/mass concentration with three wavelength optical detector systems appears to be reasonably accurate technique for evaluating the effects of engine and test cell operating conditions and fuel composition changes on the emitted particulates.

Unfortunately, the rate is a very difficult parameter to measure. The rate can be inferred from a boundary layer model that includes determining evolutions of aerosol spectra from parameterizations of generation, transport, and removal processes. Using this technique, data from CEWCOM-78 have been analyzed to produce the aerosol surface flux volume spectrum from 0.8 to 15 micrometer radius at a wind speed of 9 m/sec. Using this flux spectrum and equilibrium aerosol spectra from JASIN, flux spectra are calculated for wind speeds from 6 to 18 m/sec.

The ambient aerosol spectrum is divided into the continental and sea salt components and transformed to a reference saturation ratio, S = 0.8 (80% relative humidity). The temporal evolution of the aerosol spectrum is predicted from rate equations which require a specification of the surface production rate, the entrainment rate, (W(e)) and the mixed layer depth (h). The model was tested against a marine data set obtained off Southern California during the CEWCOM-78 experiment. The test was with two different methods of obtaining the relevant meteorological and aerosol parameters: (1) actual measurements and (2) dynamic boundary layer model prediction and parameterization. In the first case the model reproduced the aerosol data within a factor of 1.5 while in the second case the uncertainty factor was 2.0. In either case the model only modestly outperforms the much simpler Wells-Munn-Katz (WMK) model, which uses only local specification of the wind speed and humidity. Suggested improvements of the mixed layer model are presented. (Author)",,,,,,,,  |ack/ 4/15/09.;  |aGutted record reput. 12/10/97. dln.

No special hardware is required. The backends are configured in a parallel manner. A new backend may be added by replicating the existing software on an addition minicomputer. A prototype MDBS is being implemented in order to carry out design verification and performance evaluation studies. This report is the second in a series which describes the MDBS implementation. First, the overall design and implementation of MDBS is given. Then, the controller and the backends functions are described in detail. In order to facilitate performance evaluation experiments, a program to generate test data and a program to generate test requests are required. The former program was described in the first report. The latter program is described in this report. Our goal is not limited to the production of a prototype MDBS, but it is also aimed toward the application of software engineering techniques to the development of the system. Thus, the software engineering techniques being used are also discussed. The appendices contain the detailed designs fo the controller subsystem, one of the two modules in the backends subsystem (the other module, the directory management, was contained in the first report) and the test request generation module.

The vortex trajectories were determined as a function of the relative depth D/b sub o, normalized time V sub o t/b sub o, and the stratification parameter Nb sub o/V sub o. The results have shown that the vortices rise only to a finite height as they gradually demise under the influence of turbulence, sinusoidal instability, and the vortex breakdown. The effect of stratification is to reduce the lifespan of vortices and the maximum height attained by them. Various approximate analyses have been examined and new ones have been proposed to determine the lifespan of the vortices. Finally, an exploratory numerical analysis of the two-dimensional, unsteady laminar vortices has been carried out with encouraging results.

The results indicate that with the ball partially open the projectile internal flow field is severely complicated by combined viscous and shock wave interactions. A large of the drag reduction due to ball opening is obtained during the final motion o the ball and the partially open condition may lead to drags above those of the standatrd projectile, particularly at the lower Mach numbers.

Fuhs, was sponsored in part by the Naval Air Development Center (NADC). NADC desired to obtain the input of several fleet experienced aviators in order to design program code for the HP-41CV handheld, programmable calculator that would benefit pilots by providing them with fuel efficiency parameters in flight. Calculators were made available to the participants with the proviso that a completed and operable code for each aircraft be submitted by the end of the academic quarter, September 1981. Upon completion of the E-2C program, attempts were made to use the calculator in flight. One test was conducted informally in an E-2C at RVAW-110, NAS Miramar. Unfortunately, the voltage field induced in the cockpit by the main lobe of the radar passing over the cockpit caused the calculator to cease functioning.

The model is based on the rediscretization of the shear layers, wake-boundary-layer interaction, and the dissipation of vorticity. The forces acting on the cylinder, rate of vorticity flux, Strouhal number, cylinder response, oscillations of the stagnation and separation points, longitudinal and transverse spacing of the vortices, and the base pressure have been calculated and shown to be in conformity with those obtained experimentally. The model has been used to predict the characteristics of hydroelastic oscillations of a cylinder in the range of synchronization. The numerical experiments shed considerable light on the interaction between the fluid motion in the wake and the dynamics of the body. An extensive sensitivity analysis has been carried out to determine the stability of all the parameters and hence the stability of the numerical model itself.

This review includes tube-side enhancement, as well as shell-side enhancement techniques. At present, the most promising technique to enhance heat transfer on the tube side is with one of the commercially available, mildly indented, corrugated tubes. With this type of tube, the shell-side heat transfer enhancement is not as large and is uncertain due to the, as yet determined, complex effects of vapor shear and condensate inundation. Large bundle tests with enhanced tubing are therefore required before the details of tube-to-tube interaction will be fully understood.

These include the data structures -- those mechanisms that the language provides for organizing elementary data values. They also include the control structures, which organize the control flow. Less obviously, they include the same structures, which partition and organize the name space. Languages can be compared relative to their structures in the data, control, and name domains. This report describes a syntax-independent method of representing the structures of a language which facilitates visual complexity comparisons and is amenable to measurement. The data, control, and name structures of a number of languages are analyzed, including Pascal, LISP, Algol-60, Algol-68, the lambda calculus, FORTRAN, and Basic.

Specifically, the purpose of the research was to establish the percentage accuracy level at which a user becomes frustrated and decides not to use a voice recognition device. The experiment consisted of controlling the perceived recognition accuracy of a voice recognition system and then collecting data through the use of a questionnaire from the experimental users on the acceptability of the equipment. The experiment was not totally successful for a variety of reasons. This paper will discuss the research methodology, review the data collected, and suggest possible alternatives to the experimental design to overcome the problem areas encountered.

Other languages, such a Smalltalk, are described as object-oriented. LISP has been described as both value-oriented and object-oriented. What exactly do these terms mean? This paper attempts to identify and clarify the differences between values and objects and, hence, between value-oriented and object-oriented languages. The paper then turns to the question of whether objects should be included in applicative languages and the role they can fill in those languages. The remainder of the paper is a proposal for one approach to a true object-oriented programming. This includes both an informal description of object-oriented programming constructs and a formal semantics for these constructs. Nondeterminacy, synchronization and recovery from failures are briefly discussed.

It is conceivable that in future applications of VR technology, it may be costly or impractical to provide practice and training to all users. The findings suggest that first time users of VR equipment, will obtain 96.85% recognition accuracy, a level at least as high as that obtained by users who have received training or practiced speaking to the VRD. Neither nonrecognitions (e.g., errors where the system rejects the input and responds, in effect, with I don't understand you, say it again) or misrecognitions (e.g., errors where the system accepts the input but mistakes it for a different input) differed significantly for naive speakers versus practiced speakers. Furthermore, the misrecognition rate for naive speakers was only 1.11%. It was concluded that training and practice may not always be necessary in order to obtain optimum performance in the human-VRD system. Without the need for practice, which implies modifying the human's behavior, the human-machine interaction is more natural, the friendliness of the VRD is enhanced, and the cost of the VR system use is reduced.",,,,,,,,,,,,, 0|aAutomatic speech recognition.; 0|aSpeech perception.; 0|aSpeech processing systems.; 0|aVoice.,,,,"1 |aMartin, B.

The objective is to formalize notions such as 'size', 'complexity', 'orthogonality', and 'simplicity'. Three different kinds of metrics are describes: syntactic, semantic, and transformational. Syntactic metrics are based on the size of a context-free grammar for a language or a part of a language. They can be used to judge the size of a language and the relative sizes of its parts. These techniques are demonstrated by their application to Pascal, Algol-60, and Ada. Syntactic metrics make no reference to the meaning of a language's constructs. For this purpose we have developed several semantic metrics that measure the interdependencies among the basic semantic ideas in a language. This technique has been applied to the control, data, and name structures of FORTRAN, BASIC, Lisp, Algol-60, and Pascal. Finally, we suggest that a useful measure of a programming language is the complexity of the relationship between its syntactic and semantic structures. For this purpose we introduce a transformational metric and demonstrate its use on subsystems of several languages.",,,,,,,,,,,,,17|aProgrammeertalen.|2gtt; 0|aProgramming languages (Electronic computers)|xSyntax.; 0|aProgramming languages (Electronic computers)|xSemantics.; 0|aProgramming languages (Electronic computers)|xVersification.,,,,,2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,,  |lgen|nL|aQA76.7|b.M232 1982|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768000506570,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

It introduces a canonical auxiliary parity-condition problem for the determination of a single parity -condition parameter (""the enemy force equivalent of a friendly force of unit strength"") and new exponential-like general Lanchester functions.   Prediction of force annihilation within a fixed finite time would involve the use of tabulations of the quotient of tow Lanchester functions.  These force-annihilation results provide further information on the mathematical properties of hyperbolic-like general Lanchester functions: in particular, the parity-condition parameter is related to the range of the quotient of two such hperbolic-like general Lancehster functions.  Different parity-condition parameter results and different new exponential-like general Lanchester functions arise from different mathematical forms for the attrition-rat coefficients.  This theory is applied to general power attrition-rate coefficients: exact force-annihilation results are obtained when the so-called offset parameter is equal to zero, while upper and lower bounds for the parity-condition parameter are obtained when the offset parameter is positive.

Previous research has shown that the prediction of battle outcome (in particular, force annihilation) without having to spend the time and effort of computing force-level trajectories depends on a single parameter, the so-called parity-condition parameter, which only depends on the attrition-rate coefficients.  Unfortunately, previous research did not show how to generally determine this parameter.  We present general theoretical considerations for its numerical noniterative determination.  This general theory is applied to an important class of attrition-rate coefficients (offset power attrition-rate coefficients).  Our results allow one to study such variable-coefficient combat models almost as easily and thoroughly as Lanchester's classic constant-coefficient model.

It considers the initial-commitment decision as a one-sided static optimization problem and examines this non-linear program for each of three decision criteria (victor's losses, loss ratio, and loss difference) and for each of two different battle-termination conditions (given force-level breakpoint and given force-ratio breakpoint).  The paper's main contribution is to show how to determine the sign of the partial derivative of the decision criterion with respect to the victor's initial force level for general combat dynamics without explicitly solving the Lanchester-type combat equations.  Consequently, the victor's optimal initial-commitment decision many times may be determined from how the instantaneous casualty-exchange ratio varies with changes in the victor's force level and time.  Convexity of the instantaneous casualty-exchange ratio is shown to imply convexity of the decision criterion so that conditions of decreasing marginal returns may be identified also without solving the combat equations.  The optimal initial-commitment decision is shown to be sensitive to the decision criterion for fixed force-ratio breakpoint battles.

This program has been carried out for tactical allocation problems with the combat described by Lanchester-type equations of warfare.  Both deterministic and stochastic attrition processes have been considered, although the major emphasis has been on the former.  Optimal allocation policies have been developed for numerous one-sided optimization problems of tactical interest with deterministic Lanchester-type attrition processes in order to study the dependence of the structure of these optimal policies upon model form.  Problem areas in applying current mathematical theories to solve such problems are discussed.  An important gap in the existing theory of differential games is identified.  Various attrition models are considered (reflecting different assumptions as to target acquisition process, command and control capabilities, target engagement process, variations in range capabilities of weapon systems).

A major reason behind considering voice data entry was the desire to increase the speed and accuracy in which data could be entered into the system. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of voice data entry to TACFIRE, the speed and accuracy advantages of voice recognition technology had to be weighted against numerous performance characteristics of available state of the art recognition equipment. One such performance factor was vocabulary size limitation. This report analyzes the vocabulary requirements needed to operate the Artillery Control Console from a Division artillery display group shelter. It also presents the suggested vocabulary organization within the constraints of a specific recognizer which tested to be best suited for the TACFIRE environment.

It is shown that the relative fire effectiveness of the two combatants and the intensity of combat are two key parameters determining the course of such Lanchester-type combat. New victory-prediction conditions that allow one to forecast the battle's outcome without explicitly solving the deterministic combat equations and computing force-level trajectories are developed for fixed-force-ratio-breakpoint battles by considering Liouville's normal form. These general results are applied to two special cases of combat modelled with general power attrition-rate coefficients. A refinement of a previously know victory-prediction condition is given. Temporal variations in relative fire effectiveness play a central role in these victory-prediction results.

General expressions giving upper and lower bounds on the availability are derived, as well as an estimate of the error. Several of the bounds with greatest practical consequence are worked out and illustrated for a gamma repair distribution with any integer shape parameter. The case of constant repair is compared to the case of gamma repair with a large shape parameter. Finally, some simulation results using a log normal repair distribution are compared to the gamma results, suggesting that a gamma distribution can be used in lieu of a log normal for purposes of computing the availability function.

Phased mission profiles tend to be associated with more general phased missions, in which there can also be changes in the system configuration that is relevant to mission success, but many systems with a stable configuration are exposed to phased mission profiles. Predictions of the probability of mission success for a system typically result from combining predicted probabilities of mission success for its components according to logic model for the system's configuration. We investigate the effect that the depth to which the logic model is carried has on predictions, when the predictions at the component level are made using a 'standard' methodology.

The aircraft chosen for study was the A-7E. The powerplant was the TF41-A-2, a turbofan engine with a relatively slow throttle response in the approach power range. The effects of additional inputs to the approach power compensator were evaluated. It was shown that a considerable increase in performance could be achieved through the incorporation of longitudinal feedback.

The modifications suggested require a redesign of the approach power compensator system currently in use by the Navy.

Pilot acceptance of the rigid cockpit controllers was determined by comparing individual pilot ratings of the sticks. In general, in both performance and opinion, the rigid systems were found to be superior to their moveable counterparts. Steps were taken to avoid errors due to pilot bias, learning, fatigue, or adaptation. The results obtained are subject to several test limitations, including the low stick-force levels employed the lack of aircraft vibration effects, and the realism of the simulation.

Such a transitory demand or arrival process describes many phenomena, among them being commuter rush hours, and also perhaps the effect on a population of individuals their simultaneous exposure to a dosage of medicine, a disease, or even a pollutant. The paper formulates several models for the service of such demands and describes the manner in which system state may be approximated by Gaussian processes, in particular the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Wiener diffusions.

The service times for server 1 form an EARMA(1,1) process (exponential mixed autoregressive moving average process both of order 1) which is a sequence of positively correlated exponential random variables; the process in general is not Markovian. The service times for the other server are independent with a common exponential distribution. Limiting results for the number of customers in queue and the virtual waiting time at server 1 are obtained. Comparisons are made with the case of independent exponential service times for server 1.

The investigator is to investigate as many of the objects as possible before they cross the boundary.  In this paper it is assumed that all objects are moving parallel to one another directly toward the boundary.  The investigator has speed greater than the objects, and can change his course instantaneously.  Forty sample problems with 20 objects each were randomly generated and solved optimally using branch and bound methods previously developed by the authors.  In the first twenty problems, all targets have the same speed.  In the second set of twenty problems, the target speeds differ.  Solutions for the same problems were obtained through application of three easily implemented ""rules of thumb.""  The effectiveness of each rule of thumb is determined through comparison of results with the optimal solutions.

The flow is turbulent and includes supersonic, subsonic and recirculating regions. Such a model is fully described in this report. Turbulence effects are accounted for by an eddy viscosity hypothesis, and by suitable coefficients of mass, energy and entropy transport. It was found that these turbulence effects radically change the elliptically/hyperbolic characteristics of the equations as compared with the classicial case of nonturbulent compressible flow. The equations of momentum, continuity and energy for turbulent flow are shown to be elliptical for both supersonic and subsonic regions. When the second law of thermodynamics is added, the equations assume a parabolic character.

A study of the validity of that critical assumption is made.  A model of a multi-echelon supply support system which provides a history of the daily status of each entity in the system and a stock profile at each echelon is developed.  Using randomly generated demands and current replenishment rules for a representative number of items generated at representative activities at each echelon, gross supply availabilities and conditional availabilities are calculated, and statistical tests of the assumption are made.  Mean supply response times are computed using both the gross supply availabilities and the conditional availabilities to illustrate the impact of dependence among echelons.  The tests indicate that the availability of an item at a given echelon can in many cases be strongly dependent on its availability at the other echelons.  When this is so, the cost in terms of an increase in mean supply response time can be substantial.

The present effort extends a previous work by including higher harmonics in the representation of the breech force at the aft end of the motor case. Including the higher harmonics leads to a more accurate representation of the actual breech force. The results of the analysis indicate that the dynamic effects on the internal axial force in the case are negligible for a breech force duration of 0.026 seconds. This is the same conclusion that was made in the previous work based upon a simple representation of the breech force.

It was shown that the reattachment point (zone) moves toward the step inlet with wall mass addition at a constant inlet mass flux. For a given step inlet, however, the leading edge of the reattachment zone was stationary with variations in inlet velocity. A point where the wall temperature and centerline static pressure profiles leveled off simultaneously was defined as the end of the reattachment zone. This zone spread out (grew thicker) both with increasing inlet velocity for a given step size, and with increasing step height. Maximum wall temperatures occurred downstream of the reattachment zone.

If only the active duty personnel were to  use these facilities they would operate at only a fraction of that possible given the necessity to staff for the military contingency plans.  Thus, given the expansion of the health care fringe benefit package of the active duty and retired personnel, the non-active duty population for whose care the military become responsible in one form or another have been allowed, and sometimes urged to utilize at least a portion of this excess system capacity.  The end of the draft and the resulting need to compete in the marketplace for medical personnel, as well as the general inflation in the health care sector, has spotlighted the increasing cost of caring for these dependent groups.  The question has arisen of whether it might not be cheaper to shift some of this demand for health care to the civilian sector.  In this paper we examine analytically the appropriate considerations and elements to be compared in this research point out the crucial empirical work necessary to estimate such a model, discover some of the ways in which the analytical construct can provid3e bounds and directions to the hypotheses to be tested, and finally conjecture some preliminary policy recommendations.

The comparatively simple demodulation technique treated relies on the conversion of a phase-modulated (PM) signal to an amplitude-modulated (AM) signal by appropriate filtering of the frequency components of the received phase-reversal modulated carrier. The resulting AM signal is then detected with a conventional envelope detector and the digital data is recovered with appropriate threshold and logic circuits. The experimental asynchronous demodulation system requires approximately 12 db greater signal-to-noise power ratio for the same probability of error relative to the optimum performance of the coherent demodulation system. Thus with a signal-to-noise ratio of 18 db or greater, the asynchronous demodulation system has a measured probability of error of 0.001 or less; a signal-to-noise ratio of 23 db provides a measured probability of error of about 0.0001. Apart from simplicity, the asynchronous demodulation system has the advantage of not requiring prior knowledge of the transmitted signal's precise characteristics as is required in some coherent demodulation systems.

IM conveys the information of a message waveform by modulating an interval between bursts of a sinusoidal carrier. IM is accomplished by sampling the message waveform, producing a delay proportional to the amplitude of the sampled message waveform and, upon the completion of the delay, initiating a burst of a fixed number of full cycles of a sinusoidal carrier. With the completion of the burst, another sample of the message waveform is taken and the sequence of events repeats. Because the length of a burst is fixed and because the delay between bursts is dependent upon the sampled value of the message waveform, the IM signal is non-periodic. An analysis is made of the IM signal modulated by a constant voltage modulating waveform and by general modulating waveforms. Descriptions are given for the circuits used in generation and detection of the IM signal. IM signal parameters are also considered for use with message waveforms in the audio frequency range.

The new technique, called Matched-Filter Doppler Direction Finding (MFD DF) is based on the doppler DF principle in which a rotating antenna, or its equivalent, superimposes periodic frequency modulation on the received carrier. The phase of the induced modulation contains information on the angle of arrival. It is shown that a bandpass filtering operation, which satisfies the phase-matching requirement of a matched filter, converts the frequency-modulated signal to an amplitude-modulated signal whose envelope is a periodic narrow pulse with no sidelobes. The relative time of occurrence of the pulse is a measure of angle of arrival. Included is the description of and results obtained with an experimental system used to confirm the analytical results, to study the effects of noise, and to explore alternatives available in the design of an operating system. Encouraging results were obtained using this same experimental system with a conventional operating doppler DF set.

Force and moment measurements were obtained for a slender tangent-ogive/cylindrical body over a range of Reynolds numbers from 5 x 10p4s to 1.4 x 10p5s while varying the angle of attack from zero to 90 degrees and the pitch rate between zero and 281 degrees per second.  Smoke flow visualization studies were used as an aid in assessing wake vortex transitions.  The results of the investigation show that there is an increment of normal force directly attributable to the uniform pitching motion.  The incremental increase in the normal force is sufficient to cause significant errors in calculating body damping derivatives from static force measurements.  Distinct wake vortex transitions at approximately 20, 50, and 65 degrees were observed.  The effect of a uniform pitching motion shifts the angle of attack at which these wake vortex transitions occur, and can reduce the abruptness of those transitions.

The performance of each of various miniature antenna configurations is compared experimentally with that of a 16 foot untuned whip antenna. The nonlinear behavior of the negative impedance converter is explored experimentally. Also considered is the manner in which atmospheric noise level influences the design of antennas intended to operate in the frequency region below the VHF band.,  |aAlso available in print.,,,  |aMode of access: World Wide Web.;  |aSystem requirements: Adobe Acrobat reader.,,,,,,,,, 0|aAntennas (Electronics); 0|aMiniature electronic equipment.,,,,"1 |aMyers, Glen A.",2 |aNaval Postgraduate School (U.S.),,,,,,,41|uhttp://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/AD677320,  |lgen|nL|aTK7872.A6|bM95|s1|tnorm|u00001|i32768001649957,,,  |aC0|bAD#,,,

Two circularly polarized antennas, one omnidirectional and one high gain, and a high gain vertically polarized antenna have been designed, prototypes constructed and initially field tested with performance superior to the present RMS antennas.  Two other prototype antennas are nearly ready for radiation pattern testing.  The initial portions of computer simulation programs for evaluating antenna radiation patterns, as on a tank, have been completed and checked out.  The second area of investigation was concerned with the radiation link between the A and B stations.  Both laboratory and field tests have shown conclusively that multipath effects contribute significantly to large range measurement errors and to distortion and reduction in magnitude of the telemetry signals.  Recommendations are included in this report for follow-on studies to further characterize the multipath problem and to determine operational methods to minimize these effects.  In the course of investigating multipath effects, severe thermal degradation of equipment performance was observed.  A careful alignment procedure was developed by the NPS Group which permitted acceptable field operation.

Natural units are not fixed in magnitude once and for all but depend on certain physical reference parameters which change with the problem under consideration. Detailed rules are given for the orderly choice of such dimensional reference parameters and for their use in various applications.

It also extends the analysis to include the regime in which flow through part or all of the actuator disc is reversed with respect to the remote flow field. Dimensional analysis is used in a systematic manner to reduce the final results to their simplest and most significant forms. It is shown that the performance of these devices can always be represented by a single parameter family of curves in which the parameter expresses the extent to which the performance of the actual device falls short of the theoretical limit. Detailed algebraic solutions are derived in closed form for the performance of both the idealized zero torque and finite torque actuators; these represent performance limits which any comparable real device may approach but never exceed. A qualitative analysis is presented concerning the development of the vortex ring state. The fundamental dynamic stability of the ideal lifting rotor is also analyzed. While this paper deals with a classical topic in fundamental fluid mechanics, the approach employed is original and many of the results derived here are in a form that is essentially new.

Certain novel relations are thereby discovered which although unorthodox are nevertheless useful and correct.  It is shown how various systems or natural units can be constructed so as to embody the same logical structure that characterizes some given system of fixed units.  The important fact is brought out that every physical equation which is valid in some given system of units remains valid if all quantities be converted into any other system which embodies the same logical structure.  The paper also show that the dimensionless pi's of Buckingham's Pi Theorem simply represent various physical parameters as expressed in some appropriate system of consistent natural units.  The fundamental dimensional principles considered in this paper apply in some form to every quantitative analytical and experimental problem in the entire realm of physical science and engineering.

The method presently employed by NavSup in setting such reorder levels involves exponentially smoothed estimates of the mean and variance of the demand process. Any error involved in setting reorder levels results in a change in the underlying risk which in turn can be translated into costs. Such errors for the method of estimation presently employed are compared with standard maximum likelihood procedures. By simulating several normal systems, the smoothing technique is found to be inferior to classical methods with no reduction in computational difficulties.

Suggested algorithms for polynomial evaluations up to the sixth degree are presented and optimized for hand-held or desk top calculators.  Using the suggested polynomial fits and a suitable calculator, it is possible to duplicate existing table values for the various functions of the selected gases without interpolation of reference to the tables per se.

Circulation control was achieved upon the relatively thick (t/c = 0.214) elliptically shaped two-dimensional air foil by tangential jet injection at an upper surface slot just ahead of the rounded trailing edge. The experiments were conducted in the Naval Postgraduate School unsteady flow 2 x 2 foot wind tunnel. Preliminary results were obtained disclosing the nature of unsteady surface pressures over the airfoil, both amplitude and phase, relative to the oscillating cavity pressures for a range of reduced frequencies, k=0 to 0.46, at a model attitude approximating the zero lift condition (blowing-off) at a moderate value of momentum blowing coefficient.

To gain insight to this problem a model of a hemispherical turret is developed. The flow field is obtained using a second order solution based on Janzen-Rayleigh expansion for the compressible potential flow equation. Contours of constant phase distortion were calculated; results at the critical Mach number are presented and discussed. It was found that the distortion at 0 degree elevation angle was equivalent to a positive lens whereas at 90 degrees the distortion is similar to a negative lens. At 45 degrees the main effect is beam tilting into the wind. For a ratio of beam radius to turret radius equal to 0.5, the focal length at beam elevation angle of 0 degrees is 16.5km. At beam elevation of 54 degrees the beam tilt was found to be 26.5 microradians. Cruise missiles with intercontinental ranges may use celestial navigation which requires precise measurement of angular location of stars. A distorted lens created by the ambient flow field causes an error in measurement.

This report describes a more general theory which shows promise of overcoming the above limitations. The new theory involves a number of innovations in the formulation of some of the basic equations, in the formulation of certain boundary conditions, and in the formulation of the criterion of stability itself.

The calculation method adopted avoids the necessity of performing an explicit matrix inversion; all equations can be solved sequentially, one at a time. On the other hand this technique involves the evaluation of numerous integrals over the span. The calculations are cumulative, and can be carried as far as necessary to achieve any required degree of accuracy. The analysis is interesting not only for purposes of practical calculation but also for the light it sheds on the essential mathematical structure of the basic aerodynamic phenomena involved. This same general method of calculation can also be readily adapted to the solution of other common types of engineering problems.

The medium is steam containing electrically charged water droplets. The analysis takes into account the experimentally established facts that the maximum strength of the electrical field that can be sustained at incipient breakdown at the most critical location is proportional to the fluid density at that location. It is shown that as a consequence of this fact, the electrical output can be maxmized by designing the primary jet for an exit Mach number of 0.71. Estimates are made of the pump work required, of mixing losses in the ejector and of friction and secondary flow losses. The mathematical analysis is reduced to a fully non-dimensional form and the key dimensionless parameters that govern performance are clearly identified. A preliminary estimate is made of the numerical values of these parameters and the overall performance of the system is esitmated on this basis.

The numerical component (HATRACK) represents geostrophic steering of the cyclone by the Fleet Numerical Weather Central's smoothed isobaric height fields at 1000, 700, and 500 mb. The statistical component refers to the correction for bias in the numerical steering. The paper introduces an improvement in application of the statistical correction for bias. The enhanced scheme, MODIFIED HATRACK, is applied to forecasts of all named North Atlantic tropical cyclones in 1967 and 1968 and to a select number of 1967 North Pacific tropical storms and typhoons. The accuracy of MODIFIED HATRACK is found to excel the official forecast and that of the National Hurricane Center's NHC-67 technique for all forecast intervals through 48 hours. MODIFIED HATRACK errors range from an average of 40 nautical miles at 12 hours to 240 nautical miles at 48 hours. Such figures represent a 60 percent and a 10 percent reduction in errors, respectively, compared to official forecasts in the Atlantic. For the Pacific, the error reductions are of the order of 15 percent.

In the first part, the problem of the vertical structure of tropical waves generated by cumulus heating is treated for the following two cases: (1) heating is controlled by large-scale low-level convergence and (2) heating receives no feedback from large-scale motion. In the first case it is shown that waves which have a short vertical wavelength relative to the vertical scale of heating are stable, and the structure of the most unstable solution is computed. In the second case it is shown that the forcing is most efficient for the longest zonal wavelength and that the most favored vertical wavelength is about twice the vertical scale of the heating.

The forecast technique is applied in two steps. First, numerical geostrophic steering of the cyclone center is accomplished using Fleet Numerical Weather Central's analyses and prognoses of smoothed isobaric height fields, called Sr fields. Next, a statistical correction for vector bias in the numerical steering computation is used selectively in an attempt to improve the accuracy of the forecast track. The bias modification is dependent solely on the peculiarities of recent-history 12- and 24-hour forecasts in relation to the actual storm trajectory. Forecasts for intervals up to 72 hours, generated from the 1967 Atlantic operational storm positions, are compared to the results from previous experimental forecasts for 1965 using best-track positions of Atlantic storms. Results indicate the numerical scheme shows skill in relation to both 1965 and 1967 official-forecast accuracy as documented by Fleet Weather Facility, Jacksonville, Florida. In 1967, the relative improvement over official forecasts, using 700 mb prognostic SR fields for steering, ranges from 52% at forecast intervals of 7-18 hours to 9% at forecast intervals of 43-54 hours. Discussions of various forecast modes and selective modification schemes as well as stratification of error statistics by area, track, and storm stage are included.

The procedure is tested for the case of frictionless and adiabatic flow and for the case where friction and a simulated heating function is included. In addition, experiments were performed in which an 'observed' divergent wind was added in the tropics. Results are very encouraging in the sense that the amplitudes of the external inertia-gravity motions excited due to initial imbalance between the mass and wind fields are reduced considerably with the use of the procedure.
